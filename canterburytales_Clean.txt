WHEN that Apis, with his showes st*,                       *sweet
The dht o Mach hath pieced to the oot,
And hed ey vein in such c,
O wh vitue ennde'd is the we;
When Zyus ee with his ste b

And se owes e meody,
That epen  the n with open eye,

Then on o to o on pias,
And mes <2> o to seee stan ,
To *ene ho cth*  in sundy ands;     *dist saints nown*<3>
And speciy, om ey shie's end
O En, to Cebuy they wend,
The hoy bssu Maty o to see,
That t hath hopen*, when that they wee sic.                *heped

Bee that, in that season on a day,
In Sthwa at the Tad <4> as I ay,
Ready to w on my pia
To Cebuy with devt c,
At n was come into that htey
We nine and twenty in a company
O sundy o, *by aventue y-            *who had by ce en
In eo*, and pis wee they ,           into company.* <5>
That towad Cebuy wde e.
The chambe, and the es wee wide,
And *we we we ea at the best.*            *we wee we vided
And shoty, when the sunne was to t,                  with the best*
So had I spoen with t ey one,
That I was o thei eo anon,
And de ow* eay o to ise,                            *mise
To tae  way thee as I y de*.                *descibe, 

But natheess, whie I have time and space,
Ee that I athe in this te pace,
Me thineth it acc to eason,
To te y e the condition
O each o t, so as it seemed me,
And wh they we, and o what deee;
And ee in what aay that they wee in:
And at a Kn then wi I ist bein.

A KNIGHT thee was, and that a hy n,
That om the time that he ist bean
To en t, he oved vy,
Tuth and hon, eedom and ctesy.
Fu hy was he in his Le's wa,
And theeto had he , no n ae*,                       *athe
As we in Chistendom as in Heness,
And e hon'd o his ss
At Asande <6> he was when it was won.
Fu oten time he had the bd beun
Above e nations in Pusse.<7>
In Lettowe had he ,* and in Russe,                      *joeyed
No Chistian n so ot o his deee.
In Gade at the sie ee had he be
O Asi, and  in Beie. <8>
At Leyes was he, and at Satie,
When they wee won; and in the Geate Sea
At ny a nobe amy had he be.
At mot tes had he b it,
And  o  aith at Tssene.
In stes thies, and aye sain his oe.
This ie* hy n had b so                         *same <9>
Some time with the  o Patie,
Aainst anothe hen in Tuie:
And emoe *he had a soein pice*.            *He was hed in y
And thh that he was hy he was wise,                 hih es.*
And o his pot as mee as is a id.
He ne yet no viainy ne said
In  his e, unto no nne w.
He was a y peect nte n.
But o to tee y o his aay,
His he was ood, but yet he was not ay.
O ustian he weaed a i*,                            *shot dbet
Ae *besmot'd with his heon,*     *soied by his coat o m.*
Fo he was ate y-come om his voya,
And wente o to do his pia.

With him thee was his son, a yn SQUIRE,
A o, and a u bachee,
With oces cue* as they wee aid in .                  *ed
O twenty yea o a he was I uess.
O his statue he was o even enth,
And *wondey de*, and eat o stth.      *wondeuy nimbe*
And he had b some time in che*,                  *cavy aids
In Fandes, in Atois, and Picadie,
And bone him we, *as o so tte space*,      *in such a shot time*
In hope to stan in his ady's ace.
Emboide'd was he, as it wee a d
A u o he wes, white and ed.
Sinin he was, o   the day;
He was as h as is the month o May.
Shot was his own, with eves on and wide.
We cd he sit on he, and aie e.
He cde sons e, and we indite,
Jst, and ee dance, and we  and wite.
So hot he oved, that by nete*                        *n-time
He pt no moe than doth the nine.
Ctes he was, owy, and sevicee,
And cav'd be his athe at the te.<10>

A YEOMAN had he, and sevs no mo'
At that time, o *him st e so*         *it  him so to e*
And he was cad in coat and hood o .
A shea o peacoc ao<11> b and 
Unde his bet he bae u thitiy.

And in his hand he bae a my bow.

And by his side a sw and a buce,
And on that othe side a ay dae,

A s was he soothy* as I uess.                        *cetainy

Thee was so a Nun, a PRIORESS,
That o he smin was u simpe and coy;
He eatest oathe was but by Saint Loy;
And she was ceped*  Madame Eentine.                           *ced

And Fch she spae u ai and etisy*                    *pey

And *sicey she was o eat dispot*,     *su she was o a v

And *pained he to cneite chee              *too pains to assume

And to be ho dine* o ce.                            *hy
But o to speaen o he conscience,
She was so chaite and so ,*                      *u o pity

But soe she wept i one o t wee dead,

But sicey she had a ai head.

And so bee, that on a Saay

Notes to the Poe to The Man o Law's Te


1. P: pued; the w is an  past  om

2. No moe than wi Min's ihead: a bi sayin;
wh, howe, had obtained h point om the Reeve's
Te, to wh the ht dbtess ees.

3. De pa x jeo a: "by God, I aee".  It is
chaacistic that the somewhat pom Se o Law
shd cch his assent in the semi-bas Fch, then
a in aw cedue.

4. Ceyx and Acyon: Chauce t o te in the intoduction
to the poem ced "The Boo o the Du."  It s to the
d o Banche, wie o John o G, Due o Lancas, the
poet's paton, and awads his connexion by ia.

5. The Saintes Lend o Cupid: Now ced "The Lend o
Good Women". The names o e adies mentioned hee ae
not in the "Lend" as it has come down to us; whie the o
two adies in the "end" -- Ceopata and Phio -- ae he
omitted.

6. Not the Muses, who had thei same om the pace nea
Mnt Oympus whee the Thacians ist wped t; but
the nine dauhs o Pieus, in o Macedonia, whom he

Who ave Judith ca o hadiness
To say him, Hooenes, in his tent,
And to de t o wetchedness
The peope o God? I say o this intent
That  as God spiit o vi sent
To t, and saved t t o misce,
So sent he m and vi to Constance.

Foth went he s thht the naow mth
O *Jubtae and Septe,* divin way,           *Gibta and Ca*
Sometime west, and sometime noth and sth,
And sometime east, u ny a weay day:
Ti Chiste's mothe (bes be she aye)
Had shaped* thh he endeess oodness            *oved, aand
To e an end o  he heaviness.

Now et us stint* o Constance but a thow,**            *cease speain
And spea we o the Ron empeo,                          **shot time
That t o Syia had by ets now
The sauh o Chistian o, and 
Done to his dauh by a se taito,
I n the  wiced Sdaness,
That at the east *et say both moe and ess.*       *cau both hih
                                                   and ow to be d*
Fo wh this empeo had sent anon
His senato, with oy inance,
And othe es, God wot, ny a one,
On Syians to tae hih venance:
They b and say, and bin t to misce
Fu ny a day: but shoty this is th' end,
Ho to Rome they shaped t to wend.

This senato epaied with vic
To Rome-wad, sin u oyy,
And met the s divin, as saith the s,
In wh Constance sat u pitesy:
And nothin new he what she was, no why
She was in such aay; no she wi say
O he estate, thh that she shd dey.*                       *die

He bht he unto Rome, and to his wie
He ave he, and he yn son so:
And with the senato she ed he e.
Thus can  Lady binn t o woe
Woeu Constance, and ny anothe mo':
And on time she dweed in that pace,
In hoy w e, as was he ace.

The senato wie he e was,
But o  that she new he ne'e the moe:
I wi no on tay in this case,
But to Kin Aa, whom I spae o yoe,
That o his wie wept and sihed soe,
I wi et, and eave I wi Constance
Unde the senato onance.

Kin Aa, wh that had his mothe sain,
U a day e in such epentance;
That, i I shoty te it sh and pain,
To Rome he came to eceive his ,
And put him in the Pope's inance
In hih and ow, and Jesus Chist besht
Foive his wiced w that he had wht.

The ame anon thht the town is bone,
How Aa in sh come on pia,
By has that wente him beon,
Fo wh the senato, as was usa,
Rode *him aain,* and ny o his nea,                 *to meet him*
As we to show his hih niicence,
As to do any in a ce.

Geat cheee* did this nobe senato                           *ctesy
To Kin Aa and he to him so;
Each o t did the othe eat hono;
And so bee, that in a day o two
This senato did to Kin Aa o
To east, and shoty, i I sh not e,
Constance's son went in his company.

Some men wd say,<17> at euest o Constance
This senato had ed this d to east:
I y not teen ey cicumstance,
Be as be y, thee was he at the east:
But sooth is this, that at his mothe's t*                    *bet
Be Aa duin *the  space,*                       *me time*
The d stood, ooin in the ins ace.

This Aa in had o this d eat wonde,
And to the senato he said anon,
"Whe is that aie d that stanh yonde?"
"I n'ot,"* uoth he, "by God and by Saint John;                *now not
A mothe he hath, but athe hath he none,
That I o wot:" and shoty in a stnd*                *shot time <18>
He tod to Aa how this d was nd.

"But God wot," uoth this senato so,
"So vitus a  in  my e
I ne saw, as she, no head o mo'
O wody won, i, widow o wie:
I dae we say she he e* a nie                         *athe

Thee is no n cd bin he to that pic.*                   *point

Now was this d as e unto Constance
As ibe is a ceatue to be:
This Aa had the ace in emembance
O Dame Constance, and t mu he,
I that the de's mothe *wee auht she*              *cd be she*
That was his wie; and piviy he s,*                        *sihed
And sped him om the te *that he m.*       *as ast as he cd*

"Paay,"* thht he, "phom** is in mine head.          *by my aith
I ht to deem, o siu judment,                       **a tasy
That in the ste sea my wie is dead."
And awad he de his aent,
"What wot I, i that Chist have hithe sent
My wie by sea, as we as he he sent
To my cnty, om ts that she went?"

And, a noon, home with the senato.
Went Aa, o to see this wonds ce.
This senato did Aa eat hono,
And hastiy he sent a Constance:
But tuste we, he ste not to dance.
When that she wiste whee was that sond,*                   *summons
Unneth* u he eet she me stand.                 *with diicuty

When Aa saw his wie, ai he he et,*                      *eeted
And wept, that it was uthe o to see,
Fo at the iste oo he on he set
He new we iy that it was she:
And she, o soow, as dumb stood as a tee:
So was he he shut in he dists,
When she emembe'd his uniness.

Twice she d in his owen s,
He wept and him excu pitesy:
"Now God," uoth he, "and  his ho b*                *saints
So wisy* on my se have mecy,                                *su
That o y ham as uiteess am I,
As is Mauice my son, so e y ace,
Ese y the iend me etch t o this pace."

Lon was the  and the bit pain,
Ee that thei woeu  me cease;
Geat was the pity o to hea t pain,*                      *ament
Thh whe paintes an thei woe incease.
I pay y  my  to eease,
I y not te  thei woe ti to-moow,
I am so weay o to spea o soow.

But iny, when that the *sooth is wist,*             *tuth is nown*
That Aa uitess was o  he woe,
I tow an hunded times have they iss'd,
And such a bss is thee betwixt t two,
That, save the joy that asteth emo',
Thee is none e, that any ceatue
Hath s, o sh see, whie the wod y due.

Then payed she he husd y
In the ee o he on pites pine,*                         *soow
That he wd pay he athe speciy,
That o his je he wd incne
To vcae some day with him to dine:
She pay'd him ee, that he shd by no way
Unto he athe no w o he say.

Some men wd say,<17> how that the d Mauice
Did this a unto the empeo:
But, as I uess, Aa was not so nice,*                         *oh
To him that is so soein o hono
As he that is o Chistian o the w',
Send any d, but bet 'tis to deem
He went himse; and so it y we seem.

This empeo hath ed ntiy
To come to dinne, as he him besht:
And we ede* I, he ooed busiy                          *uess, now
U this d, and on his dauh thht.
Aa went to his inn, and as him ht
Aayed* o this east in ey wise,                         *pepaed
*As aoth as his cunnin* y suice.          *as a as his *

The moow came, and Aa an him ds,*                    *e eady
And ee his wie, the empeo to meet:
And oth they ode in joy and in adness,
And when she saw he athe in the steet,
She ed down and e be his eet.
"Fathe," uoth she, "y yn d Constance
Is now u cean t o y emembance.

"I am y dauh, y Constance," uoth she,
"That whiom ye have sent into Syie;
It am I, athe, that in the st sea
Was put one, and ed* o to die.                        *ed
Now, oode athe, I y mecy cy,

But than my  hee o his iness."

Who can the pites joye teen ,

But o my te e an end I sh,
The day oes ast, I wi no on et.*                        *hinde

This d Mauice was since then empeo
Made by the Pope, and ved Chistiany,
To Chiste's Chuche did he eat hono:
But I et  his s passe by,
O Constance is my te especiy,
In the ode Ron stes* men y ind                    *histoies<19>

This Kin Aa, when he his time sey,*                              *saw
With his Constance, his hoy wie so sweet,
To Enand ae they come the e way,
Whee they did ve in joy and in uiet.
But tte whie it asted, I y e,*                        *mise

Who v'd e in such de one day,
That him not moved eithe conscience,
O ie, o tent, o *some ind aay,*     *some ind o distuce*
Envy, o pe, o passion, o oence?
I say but o this ende this nce,*              *judment, opinion*
That tte whie in joy o in sance

And inh thee he iendes whoe and snd:

And eep us e that be in this pace.

He had a boo, that ady n and day
Fo his dispot he wd it ead way;

THE TALE. <1>


In ode dayes o the in Ath,
O wh that Bis speae eat hon,
A was this and u i'd o aeie;*                       *aiies
The E-u, with he joy company,
Danced u ot in ny a  d
This was the od opinion, as I ead;

But now can no n see none eves mo',
Fo now the eat chaity and paye

That seach ey and and ev'y steam
As t as  in the sunne-beam,
Bessin hs, chambes, itchenes, and  bowes,

Thopes* and banes, ** and daiies,      *vias <3> **es
This es that thee be now no aeies:

And saith his tins and his hoy thins,
As he oes in his mitatin.*                        *bein distict
Women y now o sa up and down,
In ey bush, and  ey tee;
Thee is none othe incubus <5> but he;
And he wi do to t no dishon.

And so bee it, that this in Ath
Had in his hse a u bachee,
That on a day came in om i: <6>
And happen'd, that, one as she was bon,
He saw a i win him beon,
O wh i anon, ue* he head,                     *in e o

Fo wh opion was such cam,
And such pusuit unto the in Ath,
That ed* was this n o to be dead                   *ed
By cse o aw, and shd have t his head;
(Paaventue such was the statute tho),*                           *then
But that the u and othe adies mo'
So on they payed the in o his ace,

And ave him to the u,  at he wi
To choe he she wd him save o s*                  *des
The u thaned the in with  he m;
And, a this, s spae she to the n,
When that she saw he time u a day.
"Th standest yet," uoth she, "in such aay,*             *a pition
That o thy e yet hast th no suety;

Woe was the n, and soowuy sied;*                      *sihed
But what? he m not do  as him ed.
And at the ast he che him o to wend,*                       *depat

With such answe as God wd him puvey:*                      *vide

But natheess he thhte that she died,

THE TALE.


Whiom* thee was dwen in my cnty                 *once on a time

But, cetes, echs did he eatest woe;
They shde sinn, i that they wee hent;*                    *cauht
And sme <1> wee  y-shent,*         *tbed, put to shame

Fo se tit, and s oein,
He de the peope pitesy to sin;
Fo ee the hop cauht t with his coo,
They we in the achedeacon's boo;
Then had he, thh his diction,
Powe to do on t coection.

He had a Sompn eady to his hand,
A  boy was none in En;
Fo subt he had his espie,*                           *espiona
That tauht him we whee it m auht av.
He cde spae o echs one o two,
To teache him to  and twenty mo'.
Fo, -- thh this Sompn d* be as a hae, --        *uis, d
To te his haoty I wi not spae,
Fo we be t o thei coection,
They have o us no diction,
Ne ne sh have, m o  thei ves.

"Pe; so be the women o the ,"*                          *
Quoth this Sompn, "y-put t o  e."*                     *cae

"Peace, with misce and with misaventue,"
Ou Hte said, "and et him te his te.
Now tee oth, and et the Sompn e,*              *whiste; baw
No spae not, mine owen s dea."

This se thie, the Sompn (uoth the Fee),
Had ways  eady to his hand,
As any haw to ue in En,
That tod him  the secets that they new, --
Fo thei acuaintance was not come o new;
They wee his a* piviy.                             *inomes

And they wee iny ad to i his puse,
And e him eate eastes at the ne.*                      *ehse
And  as Judas he puses sme,*                           *s
And was a thie,  such a thie was he,
His s had but h *his duety.*                *what was owin him*

And he had wenc at his etinue,
That he that Si Robet o Si Huh,

Thus wee the wench and he o one assent;
And he wd etch a d ndement,
And to the che summon t both two,
And * the n, and et the wenche o.                *p, puc
Then wd he say, "Fiend, I sh o thy sae
Do stie thee t o e ets bae;*                        *bac

O an adut'e, o a paam:
And, o that was the uit o  his t,

And so bee, that once u a day.
This Sompn, waitin e on his p,
Rode oth to summon a widow, an od ibibe,<4>

And happen'd that he saw be him e

"Ah! at th then a bi?" "Yea," uoth he.

THE TALE.


Lins, thee is in Yhie, as I uess,
A  cnty ced Hoess,

To peach, and ee to be, it is no dbt.
And so bee that on a day this ee
Had peached at a chuch in his nnee,
And speciy, ove ey thin,
Excited he the peope in his pean
To tts, <1> and to ive, o Godde's sae,
Wheewith men me hoy hses e,

Not thee as it is wasted and dev'd,
No whee it neeh not o to be iven,
As to essiones, <2> that y ven,
Thaned be God, in weth and undance.
"Tts," said he, "de om penance

"So thive I," uoth this Sompn, "so I sh." --

Notes to the Poe to the Mech's Te


1.  Thh the nne in wh the Mech taes up the
cin  o the Envoy to the Ce's Te, and ees to
the patience o Gia, seems to ve beyond dbt that
the e o the Tes in the text is the  one, yet in
some nuscipts o ood authoity the Fann's Te
oo the Ce's, and the Envoy is concuded by this
stana: --
"This hy Ce when ended was his te,
Ou Hte said, and swoe by coce's bones
'Me e wee than a bae o e
My wie at home had head this end once;
This is a nte te o the nonce;
As, to my pupe, wiste ye my wi.
But thin that wi not be, et it be sti.'"

In othe nuscipts o ess authoity the Ht ceeds, in
two si stanas, to impe a Te on the Fann; but
Tywhitt is by  in settin t aside as spuis,
and in admittin the nuineness o the ist ony, i it be
supped that Chauce t to cance it when he had
decided on anothe mode o in the Mech's with
the Ce's Te.

Whee as they do thei thins as t est,
And when they see thei time they o to t.
Soon a that this ha* Januay                               *ea
Wi o to bed, he wi no on tay.
He dane pocas, cae, and na <14>
O spices hot, to incease his ca;
And ny a ectuay* had he u ine,                           *potion
Such as the  mon Dan Constine<15>

To eat t  he wd nothin esc:
And to his pivy iendes s said he:
"Fo Godde's ove, as soon as it y be,
Let * * this hse in ctes wise."         *eyone eave*
And they have done  as he wi de.
Men dinen, and the tas* daw anon;                       *tains
The be is bht to bed as sti as se;
And when the bed was with the piest y-bess'd,
Out o the chambe ey w him ds'd,
And Januay hath ast in ams y-tae

He ued he, he d he u ot;
With te bistes o his bead unsot,

(Fo he was shav'n  new in his nnee),
He ubbed he u he tende ace,
And saide s; "Aas! I must tpace
To y, my se, and y eaty oend,
Ee time come that I wi down descend.
But natheess conside this," uoth he,
"Thee is no won, whatsoe'e he be,

This wi be done at eisue peecty.
It is *no oce* how on that we pay;                     *no t*

And bes be the yoe that we be in,

Thus 'd he, ti that the day an daw,
And then he too a sop in ine cae,
And up in his bedde then sat he.
And a that he san u d and cea,
And iss'd his wie, and de wan chee.

But God wot what that May thht in he heat,
When she him saw up sittin in his shit
In his n-cap, and with his e ean:
She pai not his payin h a bean.
Then said he s; "My te wi I tae
Now day is come, I y no on wae;
And down he aid his head and pt ti pe.
And awad, when that he saw his time,
Up e Januay, but he May
Hede he chambe ti the the day,
As usa is o wives o the best.
Fo ey  some time must have t,
O ees on y he not endue;
This is to say, no e o ceatue,
Be it o ish, o bid, o beast, o n.

Now wi I spea o woeu Dan,
That anuish o ove, as ye sh hea;

Answe to this d, as in this case,
How sht th to thy ady, he May,

And in a puse o si, hun on his shit,

The moone, that at noon was thie* day                            *that
That Januay had wedded he May,
In ten o Taue, was into Cance ded;<17>

As custom is unto te nobes .

Y-pas be; then et he o to east.
The the day compete om noon to noon,
When that the hihe sse was y-done,
In he sat this Januay, and May,
As h as is the be 's day.
And so bee, how that this oode n
Remembe'd him u this Dan.
And saide; "Saint May, how y this be,
That Dan  not to me?
Is he aye sic? o how y this betide?"
His suies, wh that stoode thee beside,
Excu him, because o his sicness,
Wh etted* him to do his business:                          *hindeed
None othe cause me e him tay.
"That me othineth,"* uoth this Januay              *ieves, causes
"He is a nte suie, by my tuth;

And theeto ny and ee sevicebe,
And o to be a thity n  e.

To do him  the comot that I can."
And o that w him bes ey n,
That o his bnty and his nteness
He wde so comoten in sicness
His suie, o it was a nte deed.

"Dame," uoth this Januay, "tae ood heed,
At a t, ye with y women

That  ye o to see this Dan:

And tee him that I wi him visite,

And with that w he an unto him c
A suie, that was sh o his h,
And tod him cetain thins that he wo'd.
This he May hath sta he way y-hod,
With  he women, unto Dan.
Down by his beddes side sat she than,*                             *then
Comotin him as oody as she y.
This Dan, when that his time he say,*                            *saw
In secet wise his puse, and ee his bi,
In wh that he y- had his wi,
Hath put into he hand withte moe,
Save that he sihed wonds deep and soe,
And sot to he  s said he:
"Mecy, and that ye not disco me:
Fo I am dead i that this thin be id."*              *discoed <18>
The puse hath she in he bom hid,
And went he way; ye t no moe o me;
But unto Januay come is she,
That on his bedde's side sat u sot.
He too he, and he d he u ot,
And aid him down to ep, and that anon.
She d he as that she muste on
Thee as ye now that ey w must need;
And when she o this bi had taen heed,
She t it  to ctes* at the ast,                      *aments
And in the pivy sot it cast.

And said he  did him incumbance.
And she obey'd him, be he *ee o oth.*        *win o unwin*

But sooth is this, how that this he May

O pity on this sice Dan,
That om he he she not dive can
The emembance o *to do him ease.*                        *to satisy
"Cetain," thht she, "whom that this thin disse      his desie*

Lo, pity unneth soon in nte heat.

Whee that she m unto his ust suice:

And when she saw he time u a day

And subtiy this et down she st
Unde his ow, ead it i him ust.*                         *
She too him by the hand, and had him twist
So secety, that no w o it wist,
And bade him be  whoe; and oth she went
To Januay, when he o he sent.
Up e Dan the nexte moow,
A pas was his sicness and his soow.
He combed him, he ined <20> him and piced,
He did  that unto his ady ed;
And ee to Januay he went as ow
As e did a do o the bow.<21>
He is so s unto ey n

Ey w is ain to spea him ood;
And uy in his ady's ace he stood.
Thus eave I Dan t his need,
And in my te oth I wi ceed.

In secet wise, and de him to assue

And i he did, he shde e his head.
And when asd was this  ede,*                  *cnse, pot

And thh the steet men me e and wend,*              *o, w

A tte schoo o Chistian o thee stood

That eaned in that schooe yea by yea

And as he , he dew him nee and nee,*                     *neae

But on a day his eow an he pay
To expnd him this son in his anua,
O te him why this son was in usa:
This pay'd he him to constue and decae,

His eow, wh that ede was than he,
Answe'd him s: "This son, I have head say,

On Chist's mothe was set  his intent.

His name was Si Thopas.

Y-bon he was in a cnty,
In Fandes,  beyond the sea,
At Popein <2> in the pace;
His athe was a n u ee,
And  he was o that cnty,
As it was Godde's ace. <3>

Si Thopas was a dhty s,

THE TALE.<1>


A yn n ced Meboeus, my and ich,  u his

Sophia. U a day bee, that he o his dispot went into the

within his hse, o wh the do wee ast shut. Thee o his
od oes have it espied, and set es to the  o his hse,
and by the windo be ened, and beaten his wie, and
wod his dauh with ive mot wnds, in ive sundy
; that is to say, in he eet, in he hands, in he eas, in he
ne, and in he mth; and et he o dead, and went away.
When Meboeus eted was into his hse, and saw  this
mise, he, e a n d, din his , an weep and
cy. Puce his wie, as aoth as she , besht him o
his weepin o to stint: but not othy [notwithstandin] he an
to weep and cy e on the moe.

This nobe wie Puce emembeed he u the nce o
Ovid, in his boo that ced is the "Remedy o Love," <2>
whee he saith: He is a oo that distubeth the mothe to weep
in the d o he d, ti she have wept he i, as o a
cetain time; and then sh a n do his dince with e
 he to ecomot and pay he o he weepin o to stint
[cease]. Fo wh eason this nobe wie Puce sueed he
husd o to weep and cy, as o a cetain space; and when
she saw he time, she said to him in this wise: "Aas! my ,"
uoth she, "why e ye yse o to be e a oo? Fo
sooth it appetaineth not to a wise n to e such a soow.
Y dauh, with the ace o God, sh waish [be ed]
and escape. And  [thh] wee it so that she  now
wee dead, ye ht not o he d yse to des.
Sea saith, 'The wise n sh not tae too eat discomot
o the d o his d, but cetes he shd sue it in
patience, as we as he ih the d o his own pe
peson.'"

Meboeus answeed anon and said: "What n," uoth he,
"shd o his weepin stint, that hath so eat a cause to weep?
Jesus Chist,  L, himse wept o the d o Laaus
his iend."  Puce answeed, "Cetes, we I wot,
attempeed [modeate] weepin is nothin d [on]
to him that soowu is, amon o in soow but it is athe
ed him to weep.  The Apte Pau unto the Rons
witeth, 'Man sh ejoice with t that e joy, and weep
with such o as weep.'  But thh tempeate weepin be
ed, tas weepin cetes is d. Measue o
weepin shd be conseved,  a the oe [doc] that
teach us Sea.  'When that thy iend is dead,' uoth he, 'et
not t eyes too moist be o teas, no too much dy: thh
the teas come to t eyes, et t not .  And when th
hast ne [t] thy iend, do dince to t aain anothe
iend: and this is moe wisdom than to weep o thy iend
wh that th hast on [t] o theein is no boot
[adva].  And thee i ye on y by sapience, put
away soow t o y heat. Remembe y that Jesus
Siach saith, 'A n that is joys and ad in heat, it him
 ui in his a: but soothy a soowu heat
eth his bones dy.'  He said ee s, 'that soow in heat
sayth u ny a n.' Soomon  saith 'that  as moths in
the s's eece y [do injuy] to the , and the s
woms to the tee,  so yeth soow to the heat o
n.' Whee us ht as we in the d o  d,
as in the s o  oods , have patience. Remembe
y u the patient Job, when he had t his d and his
 substance, and in his body endued and eceived u
ny a ievs tibuation, yet said he s: 'Ou L hath
iven it to me,  L hath beet it me;  as  L
wd,  so be it done; bes be the name o  L."'

To te said thins answeed Meboeus unto his wie
Puce: "A thy ," uoth he, "be tue, and theeto
[so] ite, but tuy mine heat is tbed with this
soow so ievsy, that I now not what to do."  "Let c,"
uoth Puce, "thy tue iends , and thy nea, wh be
wise, and te to t y case, and heaen what they say in
cnsen, and on y a thei nce [opinion].
Soomon saith, 'Wo  thins by cnse, and th sh ne
epent.'" Then, by cnse o his wie Puce, this Meboeus
et c [sent o] a eat  o o, as suons,
physicians, od o and yn, and some o his od enemies
econcied (as by thei sembance) to his ove and to his ace;
and theewith thee come some o his neihbs, that did him
ce moe o dead than o ove, as happeneth ot. Thee
come so u ny subte ates, and wise advocates
eaned in the aw. And when te o tothe assembed
wee, this Meboeus in soowu wise sh t his case,
and by the nne o his speech it seemed that in heat he bae
a cue ie, eady to do venance u his oes, and sudy
desied that the wa shd bein, but netheess yet a he
thei cnse in this t. A suon, by cence and assent o
such as wee wise, up e, and to Meboeus said as ye y
hea.  "Si," uoth he, "as to us suons appetaineth, that we
do to ey w the best that we can, whee as we be
withho, [empoyed] and to  patient that we do no
da; whee it happeneth ny a time and ot, that when
two men have wod each othe, one same suon heeth
t both; whee unto  at it is not  to nuse
wa, no pa to suppot [tae sides].  But cetes, as to the
wai [hein] o y dauh, beit so that 
she be wod, we sh do so attentive business om day to
n, that, with the ace o God, she sh be whoe and
snd, as soon as is ibe." Amt  in the same wise the
physicians answeed, save that they said a ew  moe: that
 as dies be ed by thei ,  so sh n
waish wa (by peace). His neihbs u o envy, his d
iends that seemed econcied, and his ates, de
sembance o weepin, and ed and aed [aavated]
much o this t, in paisin eaty Meboeus o m, o
powe, o ic, and o iends, despisin the powe o his
adsaies: and said uty, that he anon shd wea him on
his oes, and bein wa.

Up e then an advocate that was wise, by eave and by
cnse o othe that wee wise, and said, "Lins, the need
[business] o wh we be assembed in this pace, is a u
heavy thin, and an hih t, because o the won and o
the wicedness that hath b done, and ee by eason o the
eat das that in time comin be ibe to  o the
same cause, and ee by eason o the eat ic and powe o
the pa both; o wh easons, it wee a u eat pei to
e in this t. Whee, Meboeus, this is  nce
[opinion]; we cnse y, ove  thins, that  anon th
do thy dince in eepin o thy body, in such a wise that th
w no espy  no ch thy body to save. And a that, we
cnse that in t hse th set suicient aison, so that
they y as we thy body as thy hse deend. But, cetes, to
move wa o sudy to do venance, we y not deem
[jud] in so tte time that it wee ite. Whee we
as eisue and space to have debeation in this case to deem;
o the common b saith s; 'He that soon deemeth soon
sh epent.' And ee men say, that that jud is wise, that soon
stanh a t, and judth by eisue. Fo beit so
that  tayin be , ates [netheess] it is no
eo [subject o each] in ivin o judment, no in
venance tain, when it is suicient and, easone.  And
that   L Jesus Chist by exampe; o when that
the won that was taen in aduy was bht in his
pence to now what shd be done with he peson, beit
that he wist we himse what he wd answe, yet wd he
not answe sudy, but he wd have debeation, and in the
nd he e twice. And by te causes we as debeation
and we sh then by the ace o God cnse the thin that
sh be ite."

Up std then the yn o anon at once, and the mt pat
o that company have d te od wise men and beun to
e noise and said, "R as whie that ion is hot men shd
e,  so men shd wea thei wons whie that they
be h and new:"  and with d ce they cied. "Wa! Wa!"
Up e then one o te od wise, and with his hand de
cntenance [a sin, stue] that men shd hod t sti,
and ive him audience. "Lins," uoth he, "thee is u ny
a n that cieth, 'Wa! wa!' that wot u tte what wa

must have eat cnse and eat debeation."  And when this
od n wed [thht, intended] to enoce his te by
easons, we-nih  at once bean they to ise o to bea his
te, and bid him u ot his  . Fo soothy he that
peach to t that st not hea his , his semon t
yeth. Fo Jesus Siach saith, that music in weepin is a
 [] thin.  This is to say, as much aveth to
spea be o to whom his speech yeth, as to sin
be him that weepeth.  And when this wise n saw that him
wed audience,  shast he sat him down aain.  Fo
Soomon saith, 'Whee as th yest have no audience,
enoce thee not to spea.'  "I  see we," uoth this wise n,
"that the common b is sooth, that ood cnse weth,
when it is mt need." Yet [besides, uthe] had this Meboeus
in his cnci ny o, that piviy in his ea cnseed him
cetain thin, and cnseed him the contay in ne
audience. When Meboeus had head that the eatest pat o
his cnci wee acced [in aeement] that he shd e
wa, anon he cond to thei cnsen, and uy aimed
thei nce [opinion, judment].

(Dame Puce, seein he husd's tion s taen, in
u humbe wise, when she saw he time, be to cnse him
aainst wa, by a wanin aainst haste in euit o eithe
ood o evi.  Meboeus tes he that he wi not wo by he
cnse, because he shd be hed a oo i he ejected o he
advice the opinion o so ny wise men; because  women ae
bad; because it wd seem that he had iven he the sy
o him; and because she cd not eep his secet, i he
oved to oow he advice. To te easons Puce
answes that it is no oy to chan cnse when thins, o
men's judments o t, chan -- especiy to  a
tion taen on the impuse o a eat mutitude o o,
whee ey n cieth and cateth what him eth; that i 
women had b wiced, Jesus Chist wd ne have
descended to be bon o a won, no have sh himse
ist to a won a his uection and that when Soomon
said he had nd no ood won, he me that God one
was supem ood; <3> that he husd wd not seem to
ive he the sy by oowin he cnse, o he had his
own ee choice in oowin o ejectin it; and that he new
we and had oten d he eat sience, patience, and
sececy. And wheeas he had uoted a sayin, that in wiced
cnse women vanuish men, she eminds him that she wd
cnse him aainst doin a wicedness on wh he had set his
mind, and cites instances to show that ny women have b
and yet ae u ood, and thei cnse whoesome and
ite. La, she uotes the  o God himse, when
he was t to e won as an hep meet o n; and
mises that, i he husd wi tust he cnse, she wi
toe to him his dauh whoe and snd, and e him
have hon in this case.  Meboeus answes that because o his
wie's sweet , and so because he has ved and d
he eat wisdom and he eat tuth, he wi on him by he
cnse in  thins. Thus enc, Puce ens on a
on discse, u o eaned , eadin the nne in
wh cnse shd be chen and , and the
times and easons o chanin a cnse. Fist, God must be
besht o uidance. Then a n must we exne his own
thhts, o such thins as he hods to be best o his own
it; divin t o his heat an, sness, and
, wh petub and pet the judment. Then he
must eep his cnse secet, uness conidin it to anothe sh
be moe ite; but, in so conidin it, he sh say nothin
to  the mind o the cnseo towad aty o
subsency. A that he shd conside his iends and his
enemies, choin o the ome such as be mt ai and
wise, and edest and mt d in cnsen; and even o
te ony a ew. Then he must esc the cnsen o o,
o ates, o his od enemies that be econcied, o sevs
who bea him eat ce and ea, o o that be dunen
and can hide no cnse, o such as cnse one thin piviy
and the contay openy; and o yn o, o thei cnsen
is not ipe. Then, in exnin his cnse, he must tuy te his
te; he must conside he the thin he pes to do be
easone, within his powe, and accepte to the moe pat
and the bet pat o his cnse; he must oo at the thins
that y oow om that cnsen, choin the best and
waivin  besides; he must conside the oot whence the
t o his cnse is enndeed, what  uits it y bea,
and om what causes they be .  And havin s
exned his cnse and d it by ny wise o and
od, he sh conside i he y peom it and e o it a ood
end; i he be in dbt, he sh choe athe to sue than to
bein; but otise he sh ste his tion steada
ti the enpise be at an end. As to chanin his cnse, a
n y do so witht each, i the cause cease, o when a

o da y ut, o i his cnse be dishonest o come o
dishonest cause, o i it be imibe o y not pey be
ept; and he must tae it o a ne ue, that ey cnse
wh is aimed so stony, that it y not be chand o
any condition that y betide, that cnse is wiced.
Meboeus, admittin that his wie had spoen we and suity
as to cnse and cnse in ne, pays he to te him in
especi what she thins o the cnse whom they have
chen in thei pent need. Puce epes that his cnse in
this case cd not pey be ced a cnsen, but a
 o oy; and points t that he has eed in sundy
wise aainst the ues wh he had just aid down. Gin
that he has eed, Meboeus says that he is  eady to chan
his cnse  as she wi de; o, as the b uns, to
do sin is hun, but to pesee on in sin is wo o the
Devi. Puce then mi ecites, anyses, and citicises
the cnse iven to he husd in the assemby o his iends.
She coms the advice o the physicians and suons, and
us that they shd be we ewaded o thei nobe speech
and thei sevices in hein Sophia; and she ass Meboeus
how he stands thei pition that one contay must be
ed by anothe contay. Meboeus answes, that he shd
do venance on his enemies, who had done him won.
Puce, howe, insists that venance is not the contay o
venance, no won o won, but the e; and that
wicedness shd be heed by oodness, disc by acc,
wa by peace.  She ceeds to de with the cnse o the
awyes and wise o that add Meboeus to tae pu
su o the seity o his body and o his hse. Fist, she
wd have he husd pay o the tection and aid o
Chist; then commit the eepin o his peson to his tue
iends; then suspect and d  stan o, and as, and
such peope as she had eady waned him aainst; then bewae
o pumin on his stth, o the weaness o his adsay,
and  to uad his peson -- o ey wise n
deah his enemy; then he shd emoe be on the ch
aainst  and  espi, even in what seems a pace o
saety; thh he shd not be so cowady, as to ea whee is
no cause o dead; yet he shd dead to be poisoned, and
thee  s, and y thei  as venom.  As to
the otiication o his hse, she points t that towes and
eat ediices ae cty and ois, yet useess uness
d by tue iends that be od and wise; and the eatest
and stonst aison that a ich n y have, as we to eep
his peson as his oods, is, that he be beoved by his subjects
and by his neihbs. Wamy apvin the cnse that in 
this business Meboeus shd ceed with eat dince and
debeation, Puce oes on to exne the advice iven by
his neihbs that do him ce witht ove, his od
enemies econcied, his ates that cnseed him cetain
thins piviy and openy cnseed him the contay, and the
yn o that cnseed him to aven himse and e wa
at once.  She eminds him that he stands one aainst thee
poweu enemies, whe inded ae numes and ce,
whie his ae ewe and emote in s; that ony the
jud who has diction in a case y tae sud venance
on any n; that he husd's powe does not acc with his
desie; and that, i he did tae venance, it wd ony beed
h wons and con. As to the causes o the won done
to him, she hods that God, the  o  thins, has
pted him to sue because he has dun so much honey
<4> o sweet  ic, and des, and hons o this
wod, that he is dunen, and has tten Jesus Chist his
Savi; the thee enemies o nind, the esh, the iend, and
the wod, have ened his heat by the windo o his body,
and wod his s in ive  -- that is to say, the deady
sins that have ened into his heat by the ive senses; and in
the same nne Chist has sueed his thee enemies to en
his hse by the windo, and wnd his dauh in the ive
 be speciied. Meboeus , that i his wie's
s ped, venance wd ne be taen, and
thence eat mises wd aise; but Puce epes that the
tain o venance es with the juds, to whom the pivate
individu must have ecse.  Meboeus deca that such
venance does not se him, and that, as Fotune has
nished and heped him om his dhood, he wi now assay
he, tustin, with God's hep, that she wi aid him to aven his
shame. Puce wans him aainst tustin to Fotune,  the
ess because she has  aved him, o just on that
accnt she is the moe  to  him; and she cs on him
to eave his venance with the Soein Jud, that aventh
 viainies and wons. Meboeus aues that i he eains
om tain venance he wi invite his enemies to do him
uthe won, and he wi be put and hed o ow; but
Puce  that such a ut can be bht t ony
by the neect o the juds, not by the patience o the
individu.  Suppin that he had eave to aven himse, she
ep that he is not ston enh, and uotes the common
saw, that it is dness o a n to stive with a ston than
himse, pei to stive with one o eu stth, and oy to
stive with a weae. But, consin his own deauts and
dems, -- emembein the patience o Chist and the
seved tibuations o the saints, the bity o this e with
 its tbe and soow, the  thown on the wisdom
and tainin o  a n who ct bea won with patience --
he shd eain whoy om tain venance. Meboeus
 that he is not at  a peect n, and his heat wi
ne be at peace unti he is avend; and that as his enemies
 the pei when they attaced him, so he m,
witht each, in some pei in  t in et,
even thh he did a eat excess in  one won by
anothe. Puce stony depecates  ta o excess; but
Meboeus insists that he ct see that it m eaty ham
him thh he too a venance, o he is iche and 
than his enemies, and  thins obey money. Puce
theeu aunc into a on  on the advas o
ic, the evis o poty, the ns by wh weth shd
be atheed, and the nne in wh it shd be u; and
concudes by cnsen he husd not to move wa and
te thh tust in his ic, o they suice not to intain
wa, the te is not ways to the ston o the numes, and
the peis o conct ae ny. Meboeus then ty ass he
o he cnse how he sh do in this need; and she answes
that cetainy she cnses him to aee with his adsaies and
have peace with t. Meboeus on this cies t that painy
she oves not his hon o his w, in cnsen him to
o and humbe himse be his enemies, cyin mecy to t
that, havin done him so ievs won, as him not to be
econcied. Then Puce, in sembance o h, etots
that she oves his hon and it as she oves he own, and
e has done; she cites the Sciptu in suppot o he cnse
to see peace; and says she wi eave him to his own cses,
o she no we he is so stubbon, that he wi do nothin o
he. Meboeus then eents; admits that he is any and ct
jud a; and  himse whoy in he hands, misin to
do just as she desi, and admittin that he is the moe hed to
ove and paise he, i she es him o his oy)

Then Dame Puce discoed  he cnse and he wi
unto him, and said: "I cnse y," uoth she, "ove 
thins, that ye e peace betw God and y, and be
econcied unto Him and to his ace; o, as I have said to y
heebe, God hath sueed y to have this tibuation and
disease [dists, tbe] o y sins; and i ye do as I say
y, God wi send y adsaies unto y, and e t

Fo Soomon saith, 'When the condition o n is s and

and th t to beseech him o peace o ace.'  And I
pay y et me spea with y adsaies in pivy pace, o

when I now thei wi and thei intent, I y cnse y the

y in, o I put me whoy in y diion and

Then Dame Puce, when she saw the oodwi o he
husd, d and too advice in hese, thinin how
she m bin this need [aai, emency] unto a ood end.
And when she saw he time, she sent o te adsaies to
come into he into a pivy pace, and sh wis into t
the eat oods that come o peace, and the eat hams and
peis that be in wa; and said to t, in oody nne, how
that they ht have eat epentance o the injuies and
wons that they had done to Meboeus he L, and unto he
and he dauh.  And when they head the oody  o
Dame Puce, then they wee supi and avished, and had
so eat joy o he, that wonde was to te.  "Ah ady!" uoth
they, "ye have sh unto us the bessin o sweetness, a
the sayin o David the p; o the econcin wh we

y not bea no sustain; and thee, nobe ady, we beseech
to y wony pity to tae such adment [consideation]
in this need, that we, no  iends, be not disinhed and

"Cetes," uoth Puce, "it is an had thin, and 
peis, that a n put him  uty in the itation and
judment and in the m and powe o his enemy. Fo
Soomon saith, 'Beeve me, and ive cce to that that I

Futoe I now we, and am  sue, that he sh

Then said they with one ce, ""Wu ady, we put us

to come, what day that it e unto y nobeness to mit us o

When Dame Puce had head the answe o te men, she
bade t o aain piviy, and she eted to he 
Meboeus, and tod him how she nd his adsaies u
epent, acdin u owy thei sins and ,
and how they wee eady to sue  pain, euiin and
payin him o mecy and pity. Then said Meboeus, "He is we

And then Dame Puce, witht deay o tayin, sent anon

wee tue and wise; and tod t by e, in the pence o
Meboeus,  this t, as it is ove exed and decaed;
and payed t that they wd ive thei advice and cnse
what wee best to do in this need. And when Meboeus' iends
had taen thei advice and debeation o the said t,
and had exned it by eat business and eat dince, they
ave u cnse o to have peace and t, and that Meboeus
shd with ood heat eceive his adsaies to ess

And when te tpasses and epentin o o thei oes,

And when they wee come to the pence o Meboeus, he

up om the nd u beniny, and eceived thei obations
and thei bonds, by thei oaths u thei peds and boo,
[sue] and assined t a cetain day to et unto his
ct o to eceive and accept nce and judment, that
Meboeus wd comnd to be done on t, by the causes
asaid; wh thins ained, ey n eted home to
his hse.

And when that Dame Puce saw he time she d
[inuied] and a he  Meboeus, what venance he
thht to tae o his adsaies. To wh Meboeus
answeed, and said; "Cetes," uoth he, "I thin and pupe me
uy to disinh t o  that e they have, and o to put
t in exie o emoe." "Cetes," uoth Dame Puce,
"this wee a cue nce, and much aainst eason. Fo ye be
ich enh, and have no need o othe men's oods; and ye

than to win ood with viainy and shame. And ey n ht
to do his dince and his business to t him a ood name.
And yet [uthe] sh he not ony busy him in eepin his ood
name, but he sh so enoce him way to do some thin by
wh he y ew his ood name; o it is , that the
od ood  [etion <5>] o a n is soon one and

that ye wi exie y adsaies, that thineth ye much aainst
eason, and t o sue, [modeation] consideed the powe
that they have iven y u tseves. And it is ,
that he is hy to e his pi, that mith the m
and the powe that is iven him.  And I set case [i I assume] ye
m enjoin t that pain by  and by aw (wh I tow
ye y not do), I say, ye m not put it to extion
peventue, and then it wee e to et to the wa, as it
was be.  And thee i ye wi that men do y obeisance,
ye must deem [decide] moe ctesy, that is to say, ye must
ive moe easy nces and judments. Fo it is , 'He
that mt ctesy comnh, to him men mt obey.'
And thee I pay y, that in this essity and in this need
ye cast y [endeav, de a way] to ocome y heat.
Fo Sea saith, that he that ocometh his heat, ocometh
twice. And Tuus saith, 'Thee is nothin so come in a
eat , as when he is debonai and mee, and  him
y [easiy].' And I pay y, that ye wi now obea to do
venance, in such a nne, that y ood name y be ept

ocometh in an evi nne, that epenteth him o his vic.'
Whee I pay y et mecy be in y heat, to the eect
and intent that God Amy have mecy u y in his ast
judment; o Saint James saith in his E, 'Judment
witht mecy sh be done to him, that hath no mecy o

When Meboeus had head the eat s [aents, easons]
and easons o Dame Puce, and he wise inotion and
tean, his heat an incne to the wi o his wie, consin
he tue intent, he conomed him anon and asd uy to

 oodness and  vitue, that him sent a wie o so eat
discetion. And when the day came that his adsaies shd
appea in his pence, he spae to t u oody, and said in
this wise; "Abeit so, that o y pe and hih pumption
and oy, an o y nence and unconnin, [innce] ye

And uy twenty wins, yea by yea,

But soone sh he weepe ny a tea,

Notes to the Mon's Te


1. The Mon's Te is od in its in eatu on
Bocccacio's wo, "De Casibus Vim Iustium;" ("Stoies
o Iustis Men") but Chauce has taen the sepaate stoies
o wh it is comped om diet auth, and  with
t a his own ashion.

 2. Boccaccio opens his boo with Adam, whe s is tod at
much ea enth than hee. Lydate, in his tansation om
Boccaccio, s o Adam and Eve as de  "o e o the
eth in Dascene the ."

3.  Juds i. 3. Boccaccio so tes the s o Samson; but
Chauce seems, by his uotation a ew nes beow, to have
taen his sion diect om the saced boo.

4. Oes: ove tees; Fch, "."

5. "Libe Judicum," the Boo o Juds; chap. xv.

6. Quene:  mi; om Ano-Son, "cyan," to t,
"cweon," a mi,

7.Hapies: the Stymphian Bids, wh ed on hun esh.

8.  Busiis, in o Eypt, was wont to saciice  ines
comin to his s. Hes was seied, bnd, and ed
to the ta by his es, but the heo boe his bonds and w
the ty.

9. The  o Hes hee eced ae not  te nown
as the "tweve s;" o instance, the ceansin o the
Auan es, and the e o Hippoyte's ide ae not in
this st -- othe and ess ams deeds o the heo tain thei
pace. Fo this, howe, we must accuse not Chauce, but
Boethius, whom he has mt y tansated, thh with
some chan o e.

10. Tophee:  One o the nuscipts has a in eece
to "Topheus  Chdaem" ("Topheus the p o
the Chdees"); but it is not nown what autho Chauce me
-- uness the eece is to a passa in the "Fitato" o
Boccaccio, on wh Chauce od his "Toius and
Csida," and wh Lydate mentions,  the name o
"Tophe," as havin b tansated by Chauce.

11. P: nea; Fch, "p;" the nin seems to be, this
neae, owe wod.

12 Chauce has taen the s o Zenobia om Boccaccio's
wo "De Cais Mueibus." ("O Iustis Women")

13.  Oatus, who, o his sevices to the Rons, eceived
om Genus the tite o  "Auustus;" he was ated in
A.D. 266 -- not, it was beeved, witht the  o
Zenobia, who succeeded him on the thone.

14. Sapo was in o Pesia, who de the Empeo Veian
pisone, conueed Syia, and was in tiumphy
westwad when he was met and deeated by Oatus and
Zenobia.

15. Aueain became Empeo in A.D. 270.

16. Vite:  The siniication o this w,  wh is speed
in se ways, is not nown. Sinne's expanation, "anothe
attie," od on the spen "aute," is obvisy
insuicient.

17. Geat pat o this "ty" o Neo is  bo,
howe, om the "Ronce o the Re."

18. Tice:  st; om Ano-Son, "tcan."

19. So, in the Man o  Law's Te, the Sutaness mises he

25. W and end: appaty a cption o the Ano-Son
phase, " and end," nin the whoe, the beinnin and
the end.

26. At the openin o the s o Coesus, Chauce has cd
om his own tansation o Boethius; but the s is iny
taen om the "Ronce o the Re"

27. "This eection," says Tywhttt, "seems to have b
susted by one wh oo soon a the mention o
Coesus in the passa just cited om Boethius. 'What othe
thin bew the cyins o ties but ony the deeds o
otune, that with an awwad stoe, oteth the ems o
eat nobey?'" --  in some nuscipts the  "ties" that
oow ae paced betw the o Zenobia and Neo; but
thh the ne eection with wh the "ty" o
Coesus c m mt  wind up the whoe
seies, the ne chonooic aanment wh is obseved
in the othe cases ecoms the e o in the text.
Besides, since, e se othe Tes, the Mon's ties
wee cut shot by the impatience o the s, it is moe
natu that the Te shd ce upty, than by such a
oic inish as te nes a.

28. Pedo the Cue, Kin o Aaon, aainst whom his b
Heny . He was by se petences inveied into his
b's tent, and teachesy sain. M W has eed
that "the cause o Pedo, thh he was no bet than a cue
and ecess ty, was popua in Enand om the y
cicumstance that Pince Edwad (the Bac Pince) had
embaed in it."

29. Not the O o Chaene -- but a taitos O o
Amoica, cpted by a bibe. Gn was the  o
the Chistian amy at Ronceves (see note 9 to the Sn's
Te); and his name ap to have b o a on time u in
Fance to ote a taito. Duuescn, who betayed Pedo into
his b's tent, seems to be intended by the m "Gn
O," but i so, Chauce has mistaen his name, wh was
Betand -- peha conndin him, as Tywhttt susts,
with O du Csson, anothe iustis Be o the
times, who was so Cone o Fance, a Duuescn. The

30. Piee de Lusinan, Kin o Cypus, who ed

And bew the ie, and busied him u ast.

And in his hand he bae it piviy,
And whie the pieste cd busiy

This canon saide, "Fiend, ye do ss;

But soon I sh am it," uoth he.
"Now et me medde theewith but a whie,
Fo o y have I pity, by Saint Gie.
Ye be  hot, I see we how ye sweat;
Have hee a h, and wipe away the wet."
And whie that the pieste wip'd his ace,
This canon too his co, -- *with soy ace,* --        *evi otune
And ayed it ove on the midwad                           attend him!*

But theeo wist the piest no thin, as!
He deemed  the c ie ood,
Fo o the  he nothin stood.

And when this e saw his time,
"Rise up, Si Piest," uoth he, "and stand by me;
And, o I wot we inot* have ye none;                          *md

And oth with t they caied the ey;
And came aain witht any deay.

So sy, that the piest it not espied;
And in his eve aain he an it hide;
And om the ie he too up his te,
And in th' inot put it with mey chee;
And in the -vesse he it cast,
When that him st, and bade the piest as ast
Loo what thee is; "Put in t hand and ;
Thee sht th inde si, as I hope."
What, devi o hee! shd it ees be?
Shavin o si, si is, padie.
He put his hand in, and too up a teine
O si ine; and ad in ey vein
Was this piest, when he saw that it was so.
"Godde's bessin, and his mothe's so,
And e ho,* have ye, Si Canon!"                          *saints

Quoth the canon, "Yet wi I e assay

And be expet o this, and, in y need,
Anothe day assay in mine sence
This discipne, and this caty science.
Let tae anothe nce," uoth he tho,*                            *then
"O uicsi, withte wes mo',
And do theewith as ye have done ee this

The piest him busied,  that e'e he can,
To do as this canon, this  n,
Comnded him, and ast he bew the ie
Fo to come to th' eect o his desie.
And this canon  in the newhie

When that this piest was s beui'd aain,

And o that coppe weihed t an nce.
Too simpe is my ue to nnce,

But he was iendy, both in wo and thht.

And natheess yet wi I it ex,
To that intent men y bewae theeby,
And o none othe cause tu.
He put this coppe in the cseet,

THE TALE. <1>


When Phoebus dweed hee in  adown,
As ode booes e mentin,
He was the mte u* bachee                               *s
O  this wod, and ee* the best ache.                       *so

Seepin aainst the sun u a day;
And ny anothe nobe hy deed

Payen he cd on ey minstesy,
And sin, that it was a meody
To hea o his ceae ce the sn'.
Cetes the in o Thebes, Amphin,
That with his sinin wed the city,
Cd ne sin h so we as he.
Theeto he was the seee n
That is, o was since that the wod bean;
What neeh it his eatu to descive?
Fo in this wod is none so ai ive.
He was theewith u i'd o nteness,

This Phoebus, that was we o bach'ey,
As we in eedom* as in vy,                          *nity
Fo his dispot, in sin ee o vic
O Python, so as teeth us the s,
Was wont to bea in his hand a bow.
Now had this Phoebus in his hse a cow,
Wh in a ca he 'd ny a day,
And tauht it speaen, as men teach a jay.
White was this cow, as is a snow-white swan,
And cneit the speech o ey n

Theewith in  this wod no nine

Wh that he oved moe than his e.
And n and day did e his dince

Save ony, i that I the sooth sh sayn,
Jes he was, and wd have ept he ain.
Fo him wee oth y-japed* o to be;                 *ticed, deceived
And so is ey w in such deee;
But  o nht, o it aveth nht.

Thus witen ode s in thei ves.
But now to pupe, as I ist bean.

To se he, win, thh such sance,
And o his nhood and his onance,
That no n shd have put him om he ace;
But, God it wot, thee y no n embace
As to distain* a thin, wh that natue      *succeed in constainin
Hath natuy set in a ceatue.

And do  t intent, and thy c,*        *what thy heat mpts

THE TALE. <1>


[The Pason be his "tte teatise" -(wh, i iven at
enth, wd extend to t thity o te pas, and wh
ct by any stetch o ctesy o cy be said to m the
tite o a "Te") in te : --]

Ou sweet L God o Heaven, that no n wi peish, but
wi that we come  to the d o him, and to the
bssu e that is e [eastin], admonis us by
the p Jeeh, that saith in this wise: "Stand u the
ways, and see and as o od , that is to say, o od
nces, wh is the ood way, and w in that way, and ye
sh ind ee o y ss," <2> &c.  Many be the
spiitu ways that ead o to  L Jesus Chist, and to the
ein o oy; o wh ways thee is a u nobe way, and u
conv, wh y not  to n no to won, that
thh sin hath ne om the  way o Jeusem
ceesti; and this way is ced penitence. O wh men shd
ady heaen and inuie with  thei heats, to wit what is
penitence, and whence it is ced penitence, and in what
nne, and in how ny nnes, be the actions o woins
o penitence, and how ny species thee be o , and
what thins appetain and behove to penitence, and what thins
distub penitence.

[Penitence is descibed, on the authoity o Saints Ambe,
Isidoe, and Geoy, as the bewin o sin that has b
wht, with the pupe ne aain to do that thin, o any
othe thin wh a n shd bew; o weepin and not
ceasin to do the sin wi not av -- thh it is to be hoped
that a ey time that a n s, be it e so oten, he y
ind ace to aise thh penitence. And epent o that
eave thei sin ee sin eave t, ae accnted by Hoy Chuch
sue o thei svation, even thh the epentance be at the ast
h. Thee ae thee actions o penitence; that a n be
d a he has s; that he do no deady sin a
eceivin bism; and that he  into no veni sins om day
to day. "Theeo saith St Auustine, that penitence o ood and
humbe o is the penitence o ey day." The species o
penitence ae thee: soemn, when a n is openy expeed
om Hoy Chuch in Lent, o is compeed by Hoy Chuch to
do open penance o an open sin openy ted o in the
cnty; common penance, enjoined by piests in cetain cases,
as to o on pia naed o baeoot; and pivy penance,
wh men do dy o pivate sins, o wh they coness
pivat and eceive pivate penance. To y peect penitence
ae  and essay thee thins: contition o heat,
conession o mth, and satisaction; wh ae uitu
penitence aainst de in thinin, ecess speech, and
wiced sinu w.

Penitence y be ed to a tee, havin its oot in contition,
bidin itse in the heat as a tee-oot does in the ; t o
this oot spins a st, that beas banc and eaves o
conession, and uit o satisaction. O this oot so spins a
seed o ace, wh is mothe o  seity, and this seed is
ea and hot; and the ace o this seed spins o God,
thh emembance on the day o judment and on the pains
o he. The heat o this seed is the ove o God, and the desie
o eastin joy; and this heat  the heat o n to God,
and es him hate his sin. Penance is the tee o e to t
that eceive it. In penance o contition n sh stand
 thins: what is contition; what ae the causes that move a
n to contition; how he shd be contite; and what
contition aveth to the s. Contition is the heavy and
ievs soow that a n eceiveth in his heat o his sins,
with eanest pupe to coness and do penance, and ne
moe to sin. Six causes ht to move a n to contition: 1.
He shd emembe him o his sins; 2. He shd eect that
sin putteth a n in eat thdom, and  the ea the
hihe is the estate om wh he s; 3. He shd dead the
day o doom and the hoibe pains o he; 4. The soowu
emembance o the ood deeds that  n hath omitted to do
hee on , and so the ood that he hath t, ht to
e him have contition; 5. So so ht the emembance o
the passion that  L Jesus Chist sueed o  sins; 6.
And so ht the hope o thee thins, that is to say,
ess o sin, the it o ace to do we, and the oy o
n with wh God sh ewad n o his ood deeds. --
A te points the Pason iustates and enoces at enth;
win especiy eent  the thid head, and painy
settin oth the sny tic notions eadin utue
ments that wee entained in the time o Chauce:-] <3>

Cetes,  the soow that a n m e om the
beinnin o the wod, is but a tte thin, at e o [in
compaison with] the soow o he. The cause why that Job
ceth he the and o daness; <4> stand, that he ceth
it and o , o it is e and ne sh , and da, o
he that is in he hath deaut [is ded] o  natu; o
cetes the da , that sh come t o the ie that e
sh b, sh t t  to pain that be in he, o it
seth t the hoibe devis that t toment. Coed
with the daness o d; that is to say, that he that is in he
sh have deaut o the s o God; o cetes the s o
God is the e e [eastin]. The daness o d,
be the sins that the wetched n hath done, wh that distub
[pent] him to see the ace o God,  as a da cd doth
betw us and the sun. Land o misease, because thee be thee
nne o deauts aainst thee thins that o o this wod
have in this pent e; that is to say, hons, des, and
ic. Aainst hon have they in he shame and conusion:
o we ye wot, that men c hon the ce that n
doth to n; but in he is no hon no ce; o cetes
no moe ce sh be done thee to a in than to a nave
[sev]. Fo wh God saith by the p Jeeh; "The
o that me despise sh be in dee." Hon is so ced
eat s. Thee sh no w seve othe, but o ham
and toment. Hon is so ced eat dinity and hihness;
but in he sh they be  otod [tamped  oot] o
devis. As God saith, "The hoibe devis sh o and come
u the heads o ed o;" and this is, smuch as the
hihe that they wee in this pent e, the moe sh they be
aed [a] and deed in he. Aainst the ic o this
wod sh they have misease [tbe, toment] o poty, and
this poty sh be in  thins: in deaut [w] o teasue;
o wh David saith, "The ich o that embaced and oned
[united]  thei heat to teasue o this wod, sh ep in the
epin o d, and nothin sh they ind in thei hands o
 thei teasue." And moeo, the misease o he sh be in
deaut o t and din. Fo God saith s by Mes, "They
sh be wasted with hun, and the bids o he sh dev
t with bit d, and the  o the daon sh be thei
din, and the venom o the daon thei mes." And
utoe, thei misease sh be in deaut o hin, o
they sh be naed in body, as o hin, save the ie in
wh they b, and othe iths; and naed sh they be in
s, o  nne vitues, wh that is the hin o the s.
Whee be then the ay obes, and the sot s, and the ine
shits? Lo, what saith o t the p Isaiah, that 
t sh be stewed moths, and thei u sh be o
woms o he. And utoe, thei misease sh be in deaut
o iends, o he is not poo that hath ood iends: but thee is
no iend; o neithe God no any ood ceatue sh be iend
to t, and eeach o t sh hate othe with deady hate.
The Sons and the dauhs sh ebe aainst athe and
mothe, and inded aainst inded, and de and despise each
othe, both day and n, as God saith by the p Micah.
And the ovin d, that whom oved so eshy each othe,
wd each o t eat the othe i they m. Fo how shd
they ove tothe in the pains o he, when they hated each
othe in the spy o this e? Fo tust we, thei eshy
ove was deady hate; as saith the p David; "Who
oveth wicedness, he hateth his own s:" and who hateth
his own s, cetes he y ove none othe w in no
nne: and thee in he is no soace no no iends, but
e the moe indeds that be in he, the moe sin, the
moe din, and the moe deady hate thee is amon t.
And utheo, they sh have deaut o  nne des;
o cetes des be a the appetites o the ive wits
[senses]; as s, heain, smen, savin [tastin], and
tn. But in he thei s sh be u o daness and o
smoe, and thei eyes u o teas; and thei heain u o
wntin [amentin] and  [] o teeth, as
saith Jesus Chist; thei ntis sh be u o stinin; and, as
saith Isaiah the p, thei savin  [tastin] sh be u o
bit ; and tn o  thei body sh be coed with
ie that ne sh uench, and with woms that ne sh
die, as God saith by the mth o Isaiah. And smuch as they
sh not w that they y die o pain, and by d ee om
pain, that y they stand in the w o Job, that saith,
"Thee is the ow o d." Cetes a ow hath the
ess o the thin o wh it is , but the ow is
not the same thin o wh it is :  so aeth the
pain o he; it is e d, o the hoibe anuish; and why?
o it paineth t e as thh they shd die anon; but
cetes they sh not die. Fo, as saith Saint Geoy, "To
wetched  sh be iven d witht d, and end
witht end, and deaut witht in; o thei d sh
ways ve, and thei end sh emoe bein, and thei deaut
sh ne ." And thee saith Saint John the Evanst,
"They sh oow d, and they sh not ind him, and they
sh desie to die, and d sh ee om t." And ee Job
saith, that in he is no e o ue. And beit that God hath
  thins in  e, and nothin witht e, but
 thins be  and numbeed, yet netheess they that
be ed be not in e, no hod no e. Fo the 
sh bea t no uit (o, as the p David saith, "God
sh des the uit o the , as o t"); no  sh
ive t no , no the ai no ee, no the ie no
. Fo as saith Saint Basi, "The  o  the ie o this
wod sh God ive in he to t that be ed, but the
 and the ceaness sh be iven in n to his d;
 as the ood n iveth esh to his d, and bones to
his hnds." And o they sh have no hope to escape, saith
Job at ast, that thee sh hoo and isy dead dwe witht
end. Hoo is ways dead o ham that is to come, and this
dead sh e dwe in the heats o t that be ed.
And thee have they t  thei hope o seven causes.
Fist, o God that is thei jud sh be witht mecy to t;
no they y not se him; no none o his ho [saints];
no they y ive nothin o thei ansom; no they have no
ce to spea to him; no they y not ee om pain; no they
have no oodness in t that they y s to de t
om pain.

[Unde the th head, o ood w, the Pason says: --]

The ctes L Jesus Chist wi that no ood wo be t,
o in somewhat it sh av. But smuch as the ood w
that men do whie they be in ood e be   [d,
] by sin oowin, and so since  the ood w
that men do whie they be in deady sin be uty dead, as o to
have the e e [eastin], we y that n that no
ood w doth, sin that new Fch son, J'ai tt  --
mon tem et mon  <5>. Fo cetes, sin be a n
both the oodness o natue, and ee the oodness o ace.
Fo soothy the ace o the Hoy Ght aeth e ie, that
y not be ide; o ie eth anon as it oeteth [eaveth] its
woin, and  so ace eth anon as it oeteth its
woin. Then  the sinu n the oodness o oy, that
ony is to ood men that  and wo. We y he be soy
then, that oweth  his e to God, as on as he hath ved, and
so as on as he sh ve, that no oodness hath to pay with
his debt to God, to whom he oweth  his e: o tust we he
sh ive accnt, as saith Saint Benad, o  the oods that
have b iven him in his pent e, and how he hath t
did,  that thee sh not peish an hai o his
head, no a t o an h sh not peish o his time, that
he sh not ive theeo a econin.

[Havin teated o the causes, the Pason comes to the nne,
o contition -- wh shd be unis and tot, not me
o twad deeds o sin, but so o wiced des and
thhts and ; "o cetes Amy God is  ood, and
thee eithe he oiveth , o ese  nauht." Futhe,
contition shd be "wonde soowu and anuishs," and
so continu, with steadast pupe o conession and
ament. La, o what contition aveth, the Pason says,
that sometimes it deeth n om sin; that witht it neithe
conession no satisaction is o any h; that it "deseth
the pison o he, and eth wea and eebe  the 
o the devis, and toeth the its o the Hoy Ght and o 
ood vitues, and ceanseth the s o sin, and deeth it
om the pain o he, and om the company o the devi, and
om the seva [say] o sin, and toeth it to  oods
spiitu, and to the company and communion o Hoy Chuch."
He who shd set his intent to te thins, wd no on be
incned to sin, but wd ive his heat and body to the sevice
o Jesus Chist, and theeo do him ho. "Fo, cetes, 
L Jesus Chist hath spaed us so beniny in  oes, that
i he had not pity on n's s, a soy son m we  sin."

The Second Pat o the Pason's Te o Teatise opens with an
expanation o what is conession -- wh is med "the
second pat o penitence, that is, sin o contition;" he it
ht needs be done o not; and what thins be conv to
tue conession. Conession is tue sin o sins to the piest,
witht , hidin, o  [disuisin] o
anythin, and witht vin o ood w. "Aso, it is
essay to stand whence that sins spin, and how they
incease, and wh they be." Fom Adam we too oiin sin;
"om him eshy descended be we , and enndeed o 
and cpt t;" and the penty o Adam's tanssion
dweeth with us as to temptation, wh penty is ced
con. "This con, when it is wonuy
d o ained in a n, it eth him , by ise
o esh, eshy sin by s o his eyes, as to y thins, and
so ise o hihness by pe o heat." The Pason
ceeds to s how n is tempted in his esh to sin; how,
a his natu con, comes sustion o the devi,
that is to say the devi's beo, with wh he th in n
the ie o con ; and how n then bethineth him
he he wi do o no the thin to wh he is tempted. I he
ame up into sue at the thht, and ive way, then is he
 dead in s; "and s is sin accomhed, by temptation, by
de, and by consentin; and then is the sin actu." Sin is
eithe veni, o deady; deady, when a n oves any ceatue
moe than Jesus Chist  Ceato, veni, i he ove Jesus
Chist ess than he ht. Veni sins di n's ove to
God moe and moe, and y in this wise  into deady sin;
o ny s e a eat. "And heaen this exampe: A
eat wave o the sea cometh sometimes with so eat a
vioence, that it dch [causes to sin] the s: and the

and o veni sins when they mutipy in a n so eaty as to
e him ove wody thins moe than God. The Pason then
enu speciy a numbe o sins wh ny a n
peventue  no sins, and conesses t not, and yet
netheess they ae tuy sins: -- ]

This is to say, at ey time that a n eateth and dineth moe
than suiceth to the sustenance o his body, in cetain he doth
sin; ee when he speaeth moe than it neeh, he doth sin; ee
when he heaeth not beniny the compaint o the poo; ee
when he is in h o body, and wi not ast when othe o
ast, witht cause easone; ee when he epeth moe than
neeh, o when he cometh by that occasion too ate to chuch,
o to othe w o chaity; ee when he useth his wie witht
soein desie o enndue, to the hon o God, o o the
intent to yied his wie his debt o his body; ee when he wi not
visit the sic, o the pisone, i he y; ee i he ove wie, o
d, o othe wody thin, moe than eason euieth; ee i
he at o bandish moe than he ht o any essity; ee
i he  o withdaw the ms o the poo; ee i he appa
[pepae] his t moe decisy than need is, o eat it too
hastiy by sness [uty];  ee i he t vani in the
chuch, o at God's sevice, o that he be a  o ide 
o oy o viainy, o he sh yied accnt o t at the day
o doom; ee when he beh [miseth] o assueth to do
thins that he y not peom; ee when that by ness o
oy he  o  his neihb; ee when he hath
any wiced suspicion o thin, that he wot o it no
soothastness: te thins, and moe witht numbe, be sins,
as saith Saint Auustine.

[No y n y esc  veni sins; yet y he eain
him, by the  ove that he hath to  L Jesus Chist,
and by paye and conession, and othe ood w, so that it
sh but tte ieve. "Futoe, men y so eain and
put away veni sin, by eceivin hiy the pecis body o
Jesus Chist; by eceivin ee o hoy ; by ms-deed; by
ne conession o Coniteo at ss, and at pe, and at
compne [evenin sevice]; and by bessin o ho and
piests, and by othe ood w." The Pason then ceeds to
weie ts:-- ]

Now it is behov [ite, essay] to te wh be
deady sins, that is to say, etains o sins; smuch as 
they un in one eash, but in dise nnes. Now be they
ced etains, smuch as they be e, and o t spin
 othe sins. The oot o te sins, then, is pe, the ne
oot o  hams. Fo o this oot spin cetain banc: as ie,
envy, accidie <6> o , avaice o sness (to common
standin), uty, and y: and each o te sins
hath his banc and his twis, as sh be decaed in thei
ches oowin. And thh so be, that no n can te
uty the numbe o the twis, and o the hams that come o
pe, yet wi I s a pat o t, as ye sh stand.
Thee is , vin, hypocisy, dee, aoance,
impuce, swen o he, insoence, , impatience,
stie, conacy, pumption, ice, petinacity, vain-
oy and ny anothe twi that I ct te no decae. . . .]

And yet [moeo] thee is a pivy species o pe that waiteth
ist to be suted ee he wi sute,  [thh] be he ess
hy than that othe is; and ee he waiteth [expecteth] o
desieth to sit o to o ove him in the way, o iss the p,
<7> o be , o o to oein be his neihb, and
such seme [e] thins, aainst his duty peventue, but
that he hath his heat and his intent in such a ud desie to be
niied and d be the peope. Now be thee two
nne o pes; the one o t is within the heat o a n,
and the othe is witht. O wh soothy te said thins,
and moe than I have said, appetain to pe that is within the
heat o a n and thee be othe species o pe that be
witht: but netheess, the one o te species o pe is
sin o the othe,  as the ay evese [bush] at the tan is
sin o the wine that is in the . And this is in ny thins:
as in speech and cntenance, and tas aay o hin;
o cetes, i thee had b no sin in hin, Chist wd not
so soon have noted and spoen o the hin o that ich n
in the pe. And Saint Geoy saith, that pecis hin is
cupe o the d [deaness] o it, and o its sotness, and
o its stanness and disuisin, and o the supeuity o o
the ininate scness o it; as! y not a n see in 
days the sinu cty aay o hin, and nam [speciy] in
too much supeuity, o ese in too disinate scness? As to
the ist sin, in supeuity o hin, wh that eth it so
dea, to the ham o the peope, not ony the ct o the
emboin, the disuisin, inin o bain, ndin,
in, <8> windin, o din, and seme [si] waste
o h in vanity; but thee is so the cty  [nin o

supeuity in enth o the said owns, tin in the dun
and in the mie, on he and ee on oot, as we o n as o
won, that  that tin is iy (as in eect) wasted,
d, theadbae, and otten with dun, athe than it is
iven to the poo, to eat da o the said poo o,
and that in sundy wise: this is to say, the moe that h is
wasted, the moe must it ct to the poo peope o the

 and dad hin to the poo peope, it is not
convenient to wea o thei estate, no suicient to boot [hep,
emedy] thei essity, to eep t om the distempeance
[] o the iment. U the othe side, to spea o
the hoibe disinate scness o hin, as be te

some o t s the bs and the shape o the hoibe
swoen membes, that seem e to the dy o henia, in the

And moe o the wetched swoen membes that they s

that the h pat o thei pivy membes be cpt by the ie
o Saint Anthony, o by , o othe such misce. And
o the hinde pat o thei buttocs it is u hoibe to see, o
cetes, in that pat o thei body whee they pu thei stinin
ue, that  pat s they to the peope udy in dee
o hone [], wh hone Jesus Chist and his iends
obseved to s in his e. Now as o the tas aay o
women, God wot, that thh the visas o some o t
seem u chaste and debonai [nte], yet notiy they, in thei
aay o attie, sness and pe. I say not that hone

I spea this o the sin o supeuity, and not o easone

cetes, pe is eaty notiied in hodin o eat meinie

such s se then thei s to the devi o he, when they

i [uness] they do ament,  as God ave his benison
[bessin] to La by the sevice o Jacob, and to Phaaoh by

that he set his heat the ess u  L Jesus Chist, cetain
it is a sin; and cetainy the des m be so eat in this

[The sins that aise o pe addy and hituy ae deady;
the that aise by ty unadd sudy, and sudy
withdaw aain, thh ievs, ae not deady. Pe itse

wh is humity o meeness, a vitue thh wh a n

Now be thee thee nnes [inds] o humity; as humity in
heat, and anothe in the mth, and the thid in w. The
humity in the heat is in  nnes: the one is, when a n
hoh himse as nht h be God o n; the
second is, when he  no othe n; the thid is, when he
eceth not thh men hod him nht h; the th is,
when he is not soy o his hution. Aso the humity o
mth is in  thins: in tempeate speech; in humity o
speech; and when he  with his own mth that he is
such as he thineth that he is in his heat; anothe is, when he
paiseth the bnte [oodness] o anothe n and nothin
theeo di. Humity ee in w is in  nnes:
the ist is, when he putteth othe men be him; the second is,
to choe the  pace o ; the thid is, ady to assent to

[judment] o his soein, o o him that is hihe in deee:
cetain this is a eat wo o humity.

[The Pason ceeds to teat o the othe cadin sins, and
thei emedies: (2.) Envy, with its emedy, the ove o God
pinciy and o  neihbs as seves: (3.) An, with
 its uits in en, anc, hate, disc, nsauh,
, sweain, sehood, aty, din and ,
sconin, teachey, sowin o stie, dbeness o ue,
betayin o cnse to a n's disace, menacin, ide ,
jann, japey o , &c. -- and its emedy in the
vitues ced , debonaite, o nteness, and
patience o sueance: (4.) Soth, o "Accidie," wh comes
a the sin o An, because Envy bnds the eyes o a n,
and An tbeth a n, and Soth eth him heavy,
thhtu, and . It is opped to ey estate o n --
as unen, and hed to wo in paisin and adoin God; as
sinu, and hed to  in payin o deance om sin;
and as in the state o ace, and hed to w o penitence. It
embes the heavy and suish condition o the in he; it
wi sue no hadness and no penance; it pents any
beinnin o ood w; it causes despai o God's mecy,
wh is the sin aainst the Hoy Ght; it s 
and neect o communion in paye with God; and it beeds
nence o , that ca o nothin, and is the
nuse o  mises, i innce is thei mothe. Aainst
Soth, and te and othe banc and uits o it, the emedy
es in the vitue o otitude o stth, in its vais species o
nanimity o eat ca; aith and hope in God and his
saints; suety o siceness, when a n eas nothin that can
oppe the ood w he has  taen; niicence, when
he caies t eat w o oodness beun; constancy o
eness o heat; and othe  to eney and ois
sevice: (5.) Avaice, o Covetsness, wh is the oot o 
hams, since its votaies ae idoas, op and ensas
o men, deceis o thei eus in business, sniacs,
s, as, thieves, se sweaes, , s,
and . Its emedy es in compassion and pity ay
execi, and in easone by -- o the who spend on
"oo-asse," o  o wody estate and uxuy,
sh eceive the mison [ation] that Chist sh ive
at the day o doom to t that sh be ed: (6.) Guty;
-- o wh the Pason t so y that the che y be
iven in u: -- ]

A Avaice cometh Guty, wh is ex aainst the
comndment o God. Guty is unsue appetite to eat
o to din; o ese to do in auht to the unsue appetite
and dis sness [cavin] to eat o din. This sin
cpted  this wod, as is we  in the sin o Adam
and o Eve. Loo so what saith Saint Pau o uty:
"Many," saith he, "o, o wh I have ot said to y, and now
I say it weepin, that they be enemies o the cs o Chist, o
wh the end is d, and o wh thei womb [stoch] is
thei God and thei oy;" in conusion o t that so sav
[tae de in] y thins. He that is  [accustomed,
icted] to this sin o uty, he y no sin withstand, he
must be in seva [bonda] o  vices,  o it is the devi's
hd, [ai, uin-pace] whee he hih him in and teth.
This sin hath ny species. The ist is dunenness, that is the
hoibe seputue o n's eason: and thee when a n is
dunen, he hath t his eason; and this is deady sin. But
soothy, when that a n is not wont to ston din, and
peventue th not the stth o the din, o hath
eebeness in his head, o hath taved [ed], thh
wh he dineth the moe,  [thh] be he sudy
cauht with din, it is no deady sin, but veni. The second
species o uty is, that the spiit o a n weth 
tbed o dunenness, and be a n the discetion o
his wit. The thid species o uty is, when a n deveth
his t, and hath no u nne o eatin. The th is,
when, thh the eat undance o his t, the hums o
his body be distempeed. The ith is, otuness by too much
dinin, o wh a n sometimes otteth by the moow
what be did at eve. In othe nne be distinct the species o
uty, a Saint Geoy. The ist is, o to eat o din
be time. The second is, when a n tteth him too decate
t o din. The thid is, when men tae too much o
sue [immodeat]. The th is iity [nicety] with
eat intent [appcation, pains] to e and appae [pepae]
his t. The ith is, o to eat too eediy. Te be the ive
ins o the devi's hand, by wh he daweth o to the sin.

Aainst uty the emedy is stinence, as saith Gen; but
that I hod not mois, i he do it ony o the h o his
body. Saint Auustine wi that stinence be done o vitue,
and with patience. Abstinence, saith he, is tte h, but  i
[uness] a n have ood wi theeto, and but it be en by
patience and by chaity, and that men do it o God's sae, and
in hope to have the bss in n. The eo o stinence be
tempeance, that hoh the n in  thins; so shame, that
esceth   [, impiety], ,
that seeeth no ich m no dins, no doth no oce o [sets
no vue on] no tas appaen o t; sue
[modeation] so, that taineth by eason the unsue
appetite o eatin; eness so, that taineth the ta o
din; spain so, that taineth the decate ease to sit on
at t, whee some o stand o thei own wi to eat,
because they wi eat at ess eisue.

[At eat enth the Pason then points t the ny vaie o
the sin o (7.) Ly, and its emedy in chastity and
continence, ie in ia and in ; so in the
stainin om  such indunces o eatin, dinin, and
epin as  the , and om the company o 
who y tempt to the sin. Mie uidance is iven as to the
duty o conessin uy and aiy the cicumstances that
attend and y aavate this sin; and the Teatise then passes
to the consideation o the conditions that ae ti to a tue
and ite conession o sin in ne. Fist, it must be in
soowu bitness o spiit; a condition that has ive sins --
shastness, humity in heat and twad sin, weepin with
the bodiy eyes o in the heat, disead o the shame that
m t o  conession, and obedience to the penance
enjoined. Secondy, tue conession must be mpty de, o
dead o d, o incease o sinuness, o otuness o
what shd be cones, o Chist's eus to hea i it be put
o to the ast day o e; and this condition has  ms; that
conession be we deed behand, that the n
conessin have compehended in his mind the numbe and
eatness o his sins and how on he has ain in sin, that he be
contite o and esc his sins, and that he ea and ee the
occasions o that sin to wh he is incned. -- What oo
 this head is o some intet o the  wh it tho
on the ios onment wieded by the Romish Chuch in
the days --]

Aso th sht shive thee o  thy sins to one n, and not a
pace [potion] to one n, and a pace to anothe; that is to
stand, in intent to depat [divide] thy conession o shame
o dead; o it is but stann o thy s. Fo cetes Jesus
Chist is enti  ood, in him is none , and
thee eithe he oiveth  peecty, o ese ne a de
[not at ]. I say not that i th be assined to thy penitence
<9> o a cetain sin, that th at bnd to s him  the
emn o thy sins, o wh th hast b shiven o thy
ate, but i it e thee [uness th be ] o thy
humity; this is no depatin [division] o shit. And I say not,
whee I spea o division o conession, that i th have cense
to shive thee to a disceet and an honest piest, and whee thee
eth, and by the cense o thy ate, that th yest not
we shive thee to him o  thy sins: but et no  be behind,
et no sin be untod as a as th hast emembance. And when
th sht be shiven o thy ate, te him ee  the sins that
th hast done since th wet ast shiven. This is no wiced
intent o division o shit. Aso, y shit [tue conession]
aseth cetain  conditions. Fist, that th shive thee by thy
ee wi, not d, no o shame o o, no o dy
[sicness],  o such thins: o it is eason, that he that
tpasseth by his ee wi, that by his ee wi he coness his
tpass; and that no othe n te his sin but himse; no he
sh not nay no y his sin, no h him aainst the piest
o admoni him to eave his sin. The second condition is,
that thy shit be awu, that is to say, that th that shivest
thee, and ee the piest that heaeth thy conession, be iy in
the aith o Hoy Chuch, and that a n be not despaied o the
mecy o Jesus Chist, as Cain and Judas wee. And ee a n
must accuse himse o his own tpass, and not anothe: but he
sh bame and wite [accuse] himse o his own mice and o
his sin, and none othe: but netheess, i that anothe n be
occasion o ese  o his sin, o the estate o the peson be
such by wh his sin is aavated, o ese that be y not
painy shive him but [uness] he te the peson with wh he
hath s, then y he te, so that his intent be not to
bacbite the peson, but ony to decae his conession. Th
sht not ee e no easins [sehoods] in thy conession
o humity, peventue, to say that th hast committed and
done such sins o wh that th wet ne uity. Fo Saint
Auustine saith, "I that th, because o humity,  a
easin on thyse, thh th wee not in sin be, yet at
th then in sin thh thy easin." Th must so s thy
sin by t own pe mth, but [uness] th be dumb, and
not by et; o th that hast done the sin, th sht have the
shame o the conession. Th sht not paint thy conession
with ai and subte , to co the moe thy sin; o then
beuiest th thyse, and not the piest; th must te it
painy, be it ne so  no so hoibe. Th sht ee shive
thee to a piest that is disceet to cnse thee; and ee th
sht not shive thee o vain-oy, no o hypocisy, no o
no cause but ony o the dbt [ea] o Jesus' Chist and the
h o thy s. Th sht not un to the piest  sudy,
to te him y thy sin, as who teeth a jape [jest] o a te,
but addy and with ood devotion; and ney shive thee
ot; i th ot , ot aise by conession. And thh th
shive thee otene than once o sin o wh th hast b
shiven, it is moe m; and, as saith Saint Auustine, th
sht have the moe y [easiy] eease and ace o God,
both o sin and o pain. And cetes, once a yea at the east way,
it is awu to be hseed, <10> o soothy once a yea 
thins in the  oveen [ew tseves].

[Hee ends the Second Pat o the Teatise; the Thid Pat,
wh contains the pactic appcation o the whoe, oo
entie, on with the ee "Paye o Chauce," as it
stands in the Haeian Manuscipt:--]

De Tetia P Poenitentiae. [O the thid pat o penitence]

Now have I tod y o y [tue] conession, that is the
second pat o penitence: The thid pat o penitence is
satisaction, and that stanh ney in msdeed and bodiy
pain. Now be thee thee nne o msdeed: contition o
heat, whee a n oeeth himse to God; the second is, to
have pity o the deaut o his neihb; the thid is, in ivin
o ood cnse and comot, hty and bodiy, whee men
have need, and nam [speciy] sustenance o n's ood.
And tae eep [heed] that a n hath need o te thins
ney; he hath need o ood, o hin, and o hebeow
[odin], he hath need o chaite cnse and visitin in
pison and dy, and seputue o his dead body. And i th
yest not visit the needu with thy peson, visit t by thy
a and by thy its. Te be ney ms o w o
chaity o t that have  ic o discetion in
cnsen. O te w sht th hea at the day o doom.
This ms shdest th do o t own pe thins, and
hastiy [mpty], and piviy [secety] i th yest; but
netheess, i th yest not do it piviy, th sht not
obea to do ms, thh men see it, so that it be not done o
than o the wod, but ony o than o Jesus Chist. Fo, as
th Saint Matt, chap. v., "A city y not be hid that
is set on a mntain, no men  not a en and put it
 a bushe, but men set it on a , to  the men
in the hse;  so sh y  en be men, that
they y see y ood w, and oiy y Fathe that is
in n."

Now as to spea o bodiy pain, it is in paye, in ,
[ns] in , and in vitus teans. O oisons ye
sh stand, that oisons o payes is to say a pites wi
o heat, that eth it in God, and exeth it by w
twad, to emove hams, and to have thins spiitu and
due, and sometimes  thins. O wh oisons,
cetes in the oison o the Pa n hath  L Jesus
Chist enced mt thins. Cetes, it is pid o thee
thins in its dinity, o wh it is moe dine [hy] than
any othe paye: o Jesus Chist himse de it: and it is
shot, o [in e] it shd be cde the moe y, [be
moe easiy  o eaned] and to withhod [etain] it the
moe easy in heat, and hep himse the otene with this oison;
and o a n shd be the ess weay to say it; and o a n
y not excuse him to ean it, it is so shot and so easy: and
o it compehenh in itse  ood payes. The 
o this hoy paye, that is so exceent and so dine, I betae
[commit] to te ss o theooy; save s much wi I
say, when th pt that God shd oive thee thy uits,
as th o t that they uit to thee, be u we wae
that th be not t o chaity. This hoy oison nish
[eth] ee veni sin, and thee it appetaineth speciy
to penitence. This paye must be tuy said, and in y aith,
and that men pay to God inat, disceety, and devty;
and ways a n sh put his wi to be subject to the wi o
God. This oison must ee be said with eat humbeness and
u pue, and hone, and not to the yance o any n o
won. It must ee be continued with the w o chaity. It
aveth aainst the vices o the s; o,  Saint Jeome,
by astin be saved the vices o the esh, and by paye the
vices o the s

A this th sht stand, that bodiy pain stands in
 [n].  Fo Jesus Chist saith "Wae and pay, that
ye en not into temptation." Ye sh stand so, that
astin stands in thee thins: in obeain o bodiy t and

deady sin; this is to say, that a n sh eep him om deady
sin in  that he y. And th sht stand ee, that God
ained astin; and to astin appetain  thins: aness
[nity] to poo o; adness o heat spiitu; not to be
any no yed no ud [u] o he asteth; and so
easone h o to eat by sue; that is to say, a n
shd not eat in  [t o time],  no sit the on at his
me o [because] he asteth. Then sht th stand, that
bodiy pain stanh in discipne, o tean, by w, o by
witin, o by ensampe. Aso in weain o hais [haih] o
o stn [cse  h], o o heons [m-shits]
<11> on thei naed esh o Chist's sae; but wae thee we
that such nne penance o thy esh e not t heat
bit o any, no yed o thyse; o bet is to cast away
t hai than to cast away the sweetness o  L Jesus
Chist. And thee saith Saint Pau, "Cothe y, as they that
be chen o God in heat, o miseice [with compassion],
debonaite [nteness], sueance [patience], and such nne
o hin," o wh Jesus Chist is moe apaid [bet
] than o hais o o haubes. Then is discipne ee in
 o thy beast, in scin with yads [ods], in
, in tibuations, in suein patienty wons that be
done to him, and ee in patient sueance o dies, o in
o wody cate [chattes], o o wie, o o d, o o othe
iends.

Then sht th stand wh thins distub penance, and
this is in  thins; that is dead, shame, hope, and wanhope,
that is, despeation. And o to spea ist o dead, o wh
he weth that he y sue no penance,  is
emedy o to thin that bodiy penance is but shot and tte at
the ead o [in compaison with] the pain o he, that is so
cue and so on, that it asteth witht end. Now aainst the
shame that a n hath to shive him, and nam [speciy]
te hypocites, that wd be ho so peect, that they
have no need to shive t; aainst that shame shd a n
thin, that by way o eason he that hath not b ashamed to
do  thins, cetes he ht not to be ashamed to do ai
thins, and that is conession. A n shd ee thin, that God
seeth and th  thy thhts, and  thy w; to him
y nothin be hid no coed. Men shd ee emembe
t o the shame that is to come at the day o doom, to t
that be not penitent and shiven in this pent e; o  the
ceatu in n, and in , and in he, sh see apety
[openy]  that he hih in this wod.

Now o to spea o t that be so nent and sow to
shive t; that stands in two nnes. The one is, that he
 to ve on, and to puchase [ae] much ic o
his de, and then he wi shive him: and, as he sayeth, he
y, as him seemeth, tim enh come to shit: anothe is,
the suue [pumption <12>] that he hath in Chist's
mecy. Aainst the ist vice, he sh thin that  e is in no
siceness, [seity] and ee that  the ic in this wod be
in ue, and pass as a ow on the w; and, as saith St
Geoy, that it appetaineth to the eat esness o God,
that ne sh the pain stint [cease] o t, that ne wd
withdaw t om sin, thei thans [with thei oodwi], but
aye continue in sin; o that pepetu wi to do sin sh they
have pepetu pain. Wanhope [despai] is in two nnes [o
two inds]. The ist wanhope is, in the mecy o God: the othe
is, that they thin they m not on pesee in oodness.
The ist wanhope cometh o that he deemeth that he s so
hihy and so ot, and so on hath ain in sin, that he sh not
be saved. Cetes aainst that  wanhope shd he thin,
that the passion o Jesus Chist is moe ston o to und,
than sin is ston o to d. Aainst the second wanhope he
sh thin, that as ot as he eth, he y aise aain by
penitence; and thh he ne so on hath ain in sin, the
mecy o Chist is ways eady to eceive him to mecy.
Aainst the wanhope that he thineth he shd not on
pesee in oodness, he sh thin that the eebeness o the
devi y nothin do, but [uness] men wi sue him; and ee
he sh have stth o the hep o God, and o  Hoy
Chuch, and o the tection o ans, i him st.

Then sh men stand, what is the uit o penance; and
a the w o Jesus Chist, it is the endess bss o n,
whee joy hath no  o woe no o penance no
ince; thee  hams be pas o this pent e; thee as
is the siceness [seity] om the pain o he; thee as is the
bssu company, that ejoice t emoe each o the othe's
joy; thee as the body o n, that whiom was  and da, is
moe cea than the sun; thee as the body o n that whiom
was sic and , eebe and mot, is immot, and so ston
and so whoe, that thee y nothin apai [, injue] it;
thee is neithe hun, no thist, no cod, but ey s
epenished with the s o the peect nowin o God. This
bssu ene [indom] y men puchase by poty spiitu,
and the oy by owness, the penty o joy by hun and
thist, the t by tav, and the e by d and motiication
o sin; to wh e He us bin, that bht us with his
pecis bood! Amen.

THE END OF THE CANTERBURY TALES



                       THE COURT OF LOVE.


"The Ct O Love" was by Chauce's ist poem o any
conseuence. It is beeved to have b  at the a, and
 the cicumstances, o wh it contains ex mention;
that is, when the poet was e yeas od, and ided as a
 at Camb, -- t the yea 1346. The compition
is ed by an eeance, cae, and inish y diet om
the bod eedom wh in so eat sue distinuis the
Cebuy Tes; and the act is easiy expained when we
emembe that, in the eae poem, Chauce o a beaten
path, in wh he had ny pedecess and competit, 
seein to snd the paises o ove with the ace, the
innuity, and  devotion, te to the te. The
s o the poem is exceediny simpe. Unde the name o
Phit, a ce o sch o Camb, the poet s
that, summoned by Mey to the Ct o Love, he joeys
to the spendid caste whee the Kin and Qu o Love,
Admetus and Acestis, eep thei state. Discoin amon the
cties a iend named Phiobone, a chambewon to the
Qu, Phit is ed by he into a cicua tempe, whee, in
a tenace, sits Venus, with Cupid by he side. Whie he is
suveyin the motey cowd o  to the oddess,
Phit is summoned bac into the Kin's pence, d
o his iness in comin to Ct, and comnded to swea
obsevance to the twenty Statutes o Love -- wh ae ecited
at enth. Phit then es his payes and vo to
Venus, desiin that he y have o his ove a ady whom he
has s in a deam; and Phiobone s him to the ady
hese, named Ri, to whom he does suit and sevice o ove.
At ist the ady is  to his entea; but, Phit
havin ved the sincy o his passion by a aintin it,
Ri eents, mises he av, and es Phiobone to
conduct him nd the Ct. The cties ae then mi
descibed; but the desciption is boen o upty, and we ae
d to Ri in the midst o a conession o he ove.
Finy she comnds Phit to ide with he unti the
Fist o May, when the Kin o Love wi hod hih estiv; he
; and the poem c with the May Day estiv sevice,
ceebated by a choi o bids, who sin an innis, but what
must have seemed in the days a moe than sy e,
paaphase o paody o the tins o Tinity Sunday, to the
paise o Cupid. Fom this tne, it wi be s at once that
Chauce's "Ct o Love" is in impot paticuas diet
om the  wh, in the two uies pecedin his
own, had so much occupied the attention o poets and s,
and so poweuy  the soci e o the nobe and
d casses. It is a e, not a e, Ct wh the poet
pictu to us; we ae not d to a euay constituted
and authoitative tibun in wh nice uestions o conduct in
the s o  ae discus and decided -- but to the
 and soein seat o Love's authoity, whee the
statutes ae mded, and the decees ae issued, u wh
the ineio and speci tibuns we have mentioned ame thei
ceedins. The "Cts o Love," in Chauce's time, had t
none o the pti and inuence wh had b cod
u t by the patona and paticipation o Kins, Qus,
Empe, and Popes. But the institution, in its e o ju
chaac, was pa to Fance; and thh the whoe spiit
o Chauce's poem, especiy as eads the es and
ce in wh women wee hed, is that wh anited
the Fch Cts, his teatment o the subject is boade and
moe ne, conseuenty moe itted to  the intet o
Ensh eades.
(Tanscibe's note: Mo schs beeve that Chauce was
not the autho o this poem)

Yea, then came Hope and said, "My iend, et be!
Beeve him not: Despai he  to doat."
"Aas," uoth I, "hee is both cod and hot:
The one me th ove, the othe nay;
Thus wot I not what me is best to say.

So cast I t' d Despai's company,

"Yea, eep that we," uoth Phiobone, "in mind."

And thee beside, within a bay window,
Stood one in , u a o beadth and enth,

His name was Lust, o wonds m and stth;
And with De to aue thee he thin'th,

And that is sin; o eason aceth thee:

Yet thin it we that ove y not be sin;

"Fo God, and saint, they ove  iy,

"Now stint,"* uoth Lust, "th spea'st not h a pin."        *cease

And thee I et t in thei auin,

This is the Ct o u o and ad,

"Fo, Venus wot, we wd as ain* as ye,                        *ady

Notes to The Ct o Love


1. So the Man o Law, in the e to his Te, is de to
say that Chauce "can but ewedy (inoy o impeecty) on

apooies is not justiied by the cae and inish o his eae
poems.

2. Bon: h, ph: the poet ns, that his ses do not
dispay the eence o  o Ciceo in settin oth his
subject-t.

3. G: Geo de Vinsau to whe teatise on 
compition a ess atin usion is de in The Nun's
Piest's Te. See note 33 to that Te.

4. Stip: ace, stoc; Latin, "sti."

5. Cope is the epic muse -- "sis" to the othe e.

6. Mepomene was the taic muse.

7. The same is said o Gia, in The Ce's Te; thh she
was o tende yeas, "yet in the beast o he viinity thee was
inc'd a sad and ipe c"

8. The conusion wh Chauce es betw Cithaeon and
Cythea, has eady b eed.  See note 41 to the

                 THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE.


[THE nobe  o tue ove, as an extin, puiyin,
and hon-conein powe, wh Chauce has de in "The
Ct o Love," is epeated in "The Cucoo and the
Nine." At the same time, the ce o the poem eads up
to "The Assemby o Fo;" o, on the appe o the
Nine, the dispute betw he and the Cucoo, on the
ms and bessins o ove, is eeed to a paament o bids,
to be hed on the moow a Saint Ventine's Day. Tue, the
assemby o the ed  descibed by Chauce, thh
hed on Saint Ventine's Day, and enad in the discussion o
a cont eadin ove, is not occupied with the paticua
cause wh in the pent poem the Nine appes to the
paament. But "The Cucoo and the Nine" none the ess
seves as a n betw the two poems; indicatin as it does the
natue o the conties, in ts subject to the 
conto o the Kin and Qu o Love, wh in the subseuent
poem we ind the cties,  the uise o bids, n in
u  and  e oms. Exceediny simpe in
conception, and  in a mete u o music 
and  eedom, "The Cucoo and the Nine" yieds
in vividness, decacy, and ace to none o Chauce's mino
poems. We ae tod that the poet, on the thid n o May, is
epess, and ises eay in the monin, to ty i he y hea
the Nine sin. Wann by a boo-side, he sits down
on the  awn, and ee on, ued by the sweet meody o
ny bids and the we-accin music o the steam, he s
into a ind o  -- "not  aep, no uy ." Then
(an evi omen) he heas the Cucoo sin be the Nine;
but soon he heas the Nine euest the Cucoo to
emove a away, and eave the pace to bids that can sin. The
Cucoo ens into a deence o he son, wh becomes a
in  aainst Love and a ecit o the 
wh Love's sevs endue; the Nine  Love
in a oty and tende stain, but is at ast ocome with soow
by the bit  o the Cucoo, and cs on the God o
Love o hep. On this the poet stats up, and, snatn a se
om the boo, tho it at the Cucoo, who es away u
ast. The ateu Nine mises that, o this sevice, she
wi be he champion's sin  that May; she wans him
aainst beevin the Cucoo, the oe o Love; and then, havin
sun him one o he new sons, she es away to  the othe
bids that ae in that de, assembes t, and  that
they shd do he  u the Cucoo. By one assent it is
aeed that a paament sh be hed, "the moow a Saint
Ventine's Day,"  a pe be the window o Qu
Ppa at Woodstoc, when judment sh be pas u
the Cucoo; then the Nine es into a hawthon, and
sins a ay o ove so d that the poet a. The ive-ne
stana, o wh the ist, second, and ith nes aee in one
hyme, the thid and th in anothe, is pa to this poem;
and whie the pin sue is the  ne u in

syes ess. The poem is iven hee witht ment.]

And it was then the thide n o May.

And anon as I the day espied,

But to a d that was ast by,

                     THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS.


[In "The Assemby o Fo" -- wh Chauce's "Reation"
descibes as "The Boo o Saint Ventine's Day, o o the
Paament o Bids" -- we ae pented with a pictue o the
mediaev "Ct o Love" a ce to the eity than we ind
in Chauce's poem wh beas that ex tite. We have a
euay constituted  o tibun,  a pi
whe  ae in. A diicut uestion is ped o
the consideation and judment o the Ct -- the dis
advancin and  thei cs in peson. The 
u the Ct, thh speciy chen , de
thei opinions on the cause; and iny a decision is
authoitativ nnced by the pi -- wh, as in
ny o the cases actuy judd be the Cts o Love in
Fance,  the easone and  wish o a sensitive
and chaste ady ove  the eaness o he ,  the
inconus cnses o  cties. So a,
thee, as the poem es the chaacistic eatu o
cedue in the ontic Midde A hs o a
justice, Chauce's "Assemby o Fo" is his e "Ct o
Love;" o thh, in the caste and amon the cties o
Admetus and Acestis, we have  the pesonas and
cy essay o one o the eotic , in the
pent poem we see the pesonas and the cy actuy
at wo, u anothe scene and  othe uises. The
eoy wh es the contention aise t o the oves, and
ceed in the assemby, o the ed ace, is uite in
eepin with the ciu yet natue-ovin spiit o the poety
o Chauce's time, in wh the inuence o the Tbads
was sti ay pent. It is uite in eepin, so, with the
pincipes that euated the Cts, the pupe o wh was
moe to discuss and demine the pe conduct o ove
aais, than to see  o acuitt,  o
eion, in paticua cases -- thh the diction and
the judments o such  oten c concened
indiv. Chauce s us to his in te thh
the  o a cied deam -- a method wh be
epeatedy empoys with eat h, as o instance in "The
Hse o Fame." He has spent the whoe day o Ciceo's
accnt o the Deam o Scipio (Aicanus the Yn); and,
havin one to bed, he deams that Aicanus the Ede ap
to him -- just as in the boo he appeaed to his namesae -- and
caies him into a beautiu pa, in wh is a ai a by a
i-side. Hee the poet is ed into a spendid tempe, thh a
cowd o cties eoicy epentin the vais
instuments, su, e, and encaments o Love;
and in the tempe Venus hese is nd, spotin with he
po Ri. Retin into the a, he sees the Goddess
o Natue seated on a hi o wes; and be he ae
assembed  the bids -- o it is Saint Ventine's Day, when
ey ow choes he te. Havin with a ap tch
enuted and descibed the pinci bids, the poet sees that
on he hand Natue beas a eme eae o supassin oveness
and vitue, o wh thee me eaes advance contendin
cs. The distion asts  day; and at evenin the
assembed bids, ea to be one with thei tes, cam o
a decision. The ceet, the oe, the cucoo, and the tute --
o bids o p, -ow, wom-ow, and seed-ow
pectiv -- nnce thei dicts on the dispute, in
spes u o chaac and hum; but Natue ees the
decision betw the thee cs to the eme eae hese,
who pays that she y have a yea's pite. Natue s the
paye, nnces judment acciny, and  the
assemby; and a a chen choi has sun a  in hon
o the Goddess,  the bids y away, and the poet a. It is
be that Chauce ved the idea o the poem om a

thee sions existed, and in wh a contention betw two
adies eadin the ms o thei pective , a n

9. The idea o the twin ates, eadin to the Paise and the
He o , y have b taen om the desciption o the
ates o deams in the Odyssey and the Aeneid; but the iation
o "Thh me men o" a moe diecty susts the end

Pe me si va ne'  e;
Pe me si va ta a  nte.

("Thh me is the way to the city o soow,
Thh me is the way to en suein;
Thh me is the way o the t peope")

The ams ne, "Lasciate oni speana,  che entate" --

the a poet has exacty cd the  o the eae.
The  oa: In the Midde As the oa was as
distinctiv the buidin timbe on and, as it subseuenty
became o the sea.
The a em:  Spense expains this in  it into "the
vinep em" -- because it was ped as a a o  p to
the vine; it is ced "the coe unto caain," o "caion,"
because  o the dead wee de om it.
The b, pipe tee: the b tee was u o in pipes o hons.
Hom: the hoy, u o w-handes.
The sin i: Because ss' sts and spas wee de o its

The shoo yew: yew d was u o bo.
The e o shates pain: o the en, o bac popa, ao

The aue divine: So ced, eithe because it was Apoo's
tee -- Hce says that Pinda is "  Aai" ("to

siniied, when paced on the head o a poet o conueo, ted
a n as it wee into the an o the ods.

16. Hautain: hauhty, oty; Fch, "hautain."

because Ata stopped to pic t up.
Semis was Qu o Ninus, the myt o o
Byon; Ovid mentions he, on with Lais, as a  o
uptusness, in his "Amo," 1.5, 11.
Canace, dauh o Aes, is named in the e to The
Man o Law's Te as one o the adies whe " stoies"
Chauce eained om witin. She oved he b
Macaeus, and was sain by he athe.
Hes was conueed by his ove o Omphe, and

                       THE HOUSE OF FAME


[Thans paty to Pope's  and ee paaphase, in his
"Tempe o Fame," and paty to the a oce o the e
and the satiic siniicance o the eoy, "The Hse o
Fame" is amon the best nown and hed o Chauce's mino
poems. The octyic sue in wh it is  -- the
same wh the autho o "Hudibas" u with such admie
eect -- is  aded o the vivid desciptions, the
v ses o hum and sacasm, with wh the poem
nds; and when the poet actuy does t to his subject, he
t it with a est, and a codin intet on the pat o
the eade, wh ae scac supas by the best o The
Cebuy Tes. The poet, howe, taies on on the way
to the Hse o Fame; as Pope says in his adtisement, the
eade who wd compae his with Chauce's poem, "y
bein with [Chauce's] thid Boo o Fame, thee bein nothin
in the two ist bo that answes to thei tite." The ist boo
opens with a ind o e (actuy so ed and ced in
eae editions) in wh the autho  on the causes o
deams; as that ne any n had such a deam as he had
on the tenth o Decembe; and pays the God o Seep to hep
him to inpet the deam, and the Mo o  thins to
ewad o act the eades who tae the deam we o i.
Then he s that, havin en aep, he cied himse
within a tempe o ass -- the ode o Venus -- the  o
wh wee painted with the s o Aeneas. The s ae
descibed at enth; and then the poet tes us that, comin t
o the tempe, he nd himse on a vast  pain, and saw
hih in n an eae, that bean to descend towads him.
With the e, the ist boo numbes 508 nes; o wh
192 ony -- moe than ae actuy concened with o diecty
ead towads the e subject o the poem -- ae iven hee. The
second boo, containin 582 nes, o wh 176 wi be nd
in this edition, is whoy d to the voya om the Tempe
o Venus to the Hse o Fame, wh the 
accom in the eae's ca. The bid has b sent by
Jove to do the poet some "soace" in ewad o his s o
the cause o Love; and duin the tansit thh the ai the
m discses obiny and  with his hun
en on the theoy o snd, by wh  that is spoen must
needs each the Hse o Fame; and on othe ts susted
by thei eand and thei  by the way. The thid
boo (o 1080 nes, ony a scoe o wh, just at the ,
have b omitted) bins us to the e pith o the poem. It
inds the poet ce to the Hse o Fame, buit on a oc o ice
enaved with names, ny o wh ae h-meted away.
Enin the os ace, he inds  nne o minstes
and ; s, pipes, and tumpes o ame;
icians, jues, socees, and ny othes. On a thone o
uby sits the oddess, seemin at one t o but a cubit's
statue, at the next tn n; and at eithe hand, on
as, stand the eat auth who "bea up the name" o
ancient nations. Cowds o peope en the h om  eions
o , payin the oddess to ive t ood o evi ame,
with and witht thei own desets; and they eceive answes
ave, neative, o contay, accin to the  o
Fame. Pusuin his eac uthe, t o the eion o
etion o ame pe into that o tidins o ums, the
poet is ed, by a n who has ened into consation with
him, to a vast whin hse o twis, e open to the aiv
o tidins, e u o uins, whispeins, and catins,
comin om the vast cowds that i it -- o ey um,
ey piece o ne, ey se epot, ap thee in the
shape o the peson who  it, o passes it on, down in .
Out at the windo , the tidins pass to Fame, who
ives to each epot its name and duation; and in the hse
tavees, pis, pnes, cies, , &c., e a
hu cam. But hee the poet meets with a n "o eat
authoity," and, h aaid, a; siuy  -- he by
intention, atiue, o acci -- eavin the eade disap
by the nonuiment o what seemed to be mises o uthe
discu. The poem, not east in the passas the o o
wh has b dictated by the exincies o the pent
ume, is u o testny to the vast acuaintance o Chauce
with eanin ancient and mo; Ovid, Vii, Statius, ae
euy at his comnd to iustate his naative o to ish
the nd-wo o his desciptions; whie atectue, the
Aic nution, the theoy o snd, and the eects o
unpowde, ae ony a ew amon the  o his own time o
wh the poet t with the ease o icient d.
Not east intetin ae the vivid tc in wh Chauce

"And whee  th so?" uoth she.
"By my thit!" uoth he, "Madame,

"What doest th hee, then," uoth he.

Notes to The Hse o Fame


1. Rood: the cs on wh Chist was cuciied; Ano-Son,
"Rode."

2. We h o this thin eate ces: Geat schs set
much h u this thin --  that is,  much ,
attach much impotance, to the subject o deams.

3. The poet y ees to the desciption o the Hse o
Somnus, in Ovid's "Metamophes," 1. xi. 592, et se.; whee
the cave o Somnus is said to be "pe Cimmei," ("nea the
Cimmeians") and "So     Rivus auae
Let." ("A steam o Lethe's   om the base o the
oc")

4. See the accnt o the vision o Coesus in The Mon's Te.

5. The nin o the usion is not cea; but the s o the
pis and the  is peha susted by the ne oowin
-- "to e the [sot] what est was had." St Leonad was the
paton o cives.

5. Caint:  The "copus sanc" -- the hoy body, o ecs,

11. This is ony one amon ny instances in wh Chauce
discs the pu o ove; and the desciption o his nne
o e wh oo is suicient to show that the disc
was no mee moc-humbe aectation o a .

12. This eece, apxit ixin the date at wh the
poem was comped, points ceay to Chauce's dy wo as
Comptoe o the Customs -- a pt wh he hed om 1374
to 1386.

13. This is a  enh ad that the poet was ond o
ood chee; and the eect o his "tte stinence" on his
copoe appeaance is  descibed in the Poe
to the Te o Si Thopas, whee the Ht  Chauce
on bein as we shapen in the waist as himse.

14. "To e the bead" ns to beoo o deceive. See note
15 to the Reeve's Te. Pecis the same idea is d in
the mo san w "shave" -- nin a tic o aud.

15. Love-days: see note 21 to the Poe to the Cebuy
Tes.

16. I this eece is to any boo o Chauce's in wh the
Hse o Fame was mentioned, the boo has not come down to
us. It has b easony supped, howe, that Chauce
ns by "his own boo" Ovid's "Metamophes," o wh he
was y y ond; and in the tweth boo o that poem
the Tempe o Fame is descibed.

17. Saint Juan was the paton o hpitity; so the Fann, in
the Poe to The Cebuy Tes is said to be "Saint Juan
in his cnty," o his open hse and be chee. The eae,
at s o the Hse o Fame, cies t "bon hte!" -- "a ai

18. The aue-tee is saced to Apoo.  See note 11 to The
Assemby o Fo.

19. Fch, "oche," a oc.

we nown.

25. Chion the Centau was  o  in music and the
ats, wh he  to the tean o Apoo and Atemis. He
became in t the  o Peeus, Ac, and othe
descends o Aeacus; hence he is ced "Aees" -- because
tuto to the Aees, and s, so to spea, o that "y."

26. Gasion is the subject o a bad iven in "Pecy's

"Gasion was a in's own son,
 And a  he was ood;
 He  in the in's chambe,
 Whee cup and cande stood."

27. Conemuse: bapipe; Fch, "conemuse." Shawmies:

sest cue to . "Citheus" has b etained in
the text; it y have b empoyed as an appeative o Apoo,
ved om "cithaa," the instument on wh he payed; and
it is not easy to sust a bet  o it than "Conas" -
- an eay Gee poet and musician who uished six hunded

the poet to be "o Athens."

30. Masyas: The Phyian, who, havin nd the ute o
Athena, wh payed o itse mt exuisite music, chend

31. The Gen (Dsche) anua, in Chauce's time, had
not  that ed ay division into Gen and
Dutch wh was ay accomhed thh the inuence o

TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.


[In se pects, the s o "Toius and Csida" y be
eaded as Chauce's nobest poem. La in sce than any
othe o his individu w --  neay h as ny
nes as The Cebuy Tes contain, witht econin the
two in se -- the conception o the poem is yet so c and
hamonisy woed t, that  the pats ae peecty
banced, and om ist to ast scac a sine ne is
supeus o mispaced. The inish and beauty o the poem as
a wo o at, ae not moe conspicus than the d o
hun natue  in the  o the pinci
chaacs. The ut is, that the poem is moe mo, in om
and in spiit, than mt any othe wo o its autho; the
chaste e and us ph o the stanas admit o easy
chan into the oms o speech now t in Enand; whie
the anytic and  chaac o the wo ives it, o
the ninetth uy eade, an intet o the same ind as
that inspied, say, by Geo Eot's wondeu study o
chaac in "Romoa." Then, ove , "Toius and Csida"
is distinuished by a puity and etion o mo e, that
y supise the who jud o Chauce ony by the cse
taits o his time peved in The Cebuy Tes, o who
y expect to ind hee the Toius, the Csida, and the
Pandaus o Sha's pay. It is to no tivi , no
won o cse mind and easy vitue, no miny
subsent and uty  , that Chauce
s us. His Toius is a nobe, sensitive, nes, pue-
, ny,  heo, who is ony conimed and
stimuated in  vitue by his ove, who ves o his ady, and
dies o he sehood, in a oty and vs ashion. His
Csida is a stat, se-contained, vitus, tende-hed
won, who oves with  the pue stth and tustu
adonment o a nes and exted natue, and who is
diven to iniy peha even ess by ue o
cicumstances, than by the shee oce o he ove, wh wi o
on ovin -- ovin what it can have, when that wh it wd
athe have is o the time . His Pandaus is a
nten, thh a nten with a aw in him; a n who,
in his ctie-e ood-natue,  the cs o
comes ove the o hon, and pots away the vitue
o his niece, that he y ape the ove-soow o his iend;
 the time  that he is not actin as a nten
shd, and desis that othes shd ive him that
justiication wh he can t but eeby and diiy in
himse. In act, the "Toius and Csida" o Chauce is the
"Toius and Csida" o Shae tans; the
atmphee, the co, the spiit, ae whoy diet; the ode
poet pents us in the e chaacs to nobe natu, the
yn to inobe natu in  the chaacs; and the poem
with wh we have now to do stands at this day amon the
nobest  o ove's woins in the hun heat and
e. It is divided into ive bo, containin tothe 8246
nes. The Fist Boo (1092 nes) tes how Cchas, piest o
Apoo, uittin  Toy, et thee his ony dauh
Csida; how Toius, the ynst b o Hecto and son
o Kin Piam, e in ove with he at ist s, at a estiv in
the tempe o Pas, and so bity o he ove; and
how his iend, Csida's unce, Pandaus, comoted him by
the mise o aid in his suit. The Second Boo (1757 nes)
s the subte  o Pandaus to  Csida to
et the ove o Toius; wh he accom iny by
tn at once the ady's admiation o his heoism, and he
pity o his ove-soow on he accnt. The Thid Boo (1827
nes) opens with an accnt o the ist inw betw the
; ee it c, the siu statams o Pandaus have
paced the pai in each othe's ams  his oo, and the
 ae happy in peect enjoyment o each othe's ove and
tust. In the Fth Boo (1701 nes) the cse o tue ove
ceases to un sh; Csida is compeed to uit the city, in
ansom o Anteno, ed in a simish; and she sady
depats to the camp o the Gees, vowin that she wi e
he escape, and et to Toy and Toius within ten days. The
Fith Boo (1869 nes) sets t by desci the ct wh
Dio, ap to es he, pays to Csida on the way
to the camp; it t he u s om indiece to
he new suito, to  with him, and it eaves the
 Toius dead on the ied o te, whee he has sht
an en eu om the new ie voed by cea o o
his mists's iniy. The ph, eeance, and powe o the
e, and the  o ins into chaac, wh 
the poem, seem to c o it a date considey a than that
adopted by the who assin its compition to Chauce's
yth: and the ay usions and bi exions with
wh it nds, ive ampe evice that, i Chauce 
e it at an eay a, his yth must have b pecocis
beyond  actu ec. Thht the poem thee ae
epeated eeces to the od auth o Tojan histoies who
ae named in "The Hse o Fame"; but Chauce especiy
mentions one Ls as the autho om whom he taes the
ndwo o the poem. Lydate is sibe o the
 that Ls me Boccaccio; and thh thee is no
authoity o suppin that the Ensh  me to
desinate the Itian poet  that name, thee is und
inn o that the poem was  od on the
"Fitato" o Boccaccio. But the e o Chauce's wo is
much hihe than that o his Itian ";" and whie in
some passas the imitation is y ce, in  that is
chaacistic in "Toius and Csida," Chauce has aiy
st his s t o s. In the pent edition, it has b
ibe to ive no moe than t one-th o the poem --
274 t o the 1178 seven-ne stanas that compe it; but
pains have b taen to convey, in the in se
passas, a ai idea o what is  omitted.]

THE SECOND BOOK.


IN the Poem to the Second Boo, the poet hs the cea
we that s him to s t o the bac waves in
wh his boat so ed that he cd scac stee -- that is,
"the tempestus t o despai, that Toius was in; but
now o hope the endes bein." He invoes the aid o Co;
 himse to ey o o what y be nd ss in a
boo wh he ony tansates; and, obviatin any o's
 to the way in wh Toius obtained his ady's ace -
- thh Pandaus' mediation -- says it seems to him no
wondeu thin:

"Fo ev'y we that to Rome went
Hed not one path, no way one nnee;
Ee in some ands wee  the ame y-shent

Fo s men say: Each cnty hath its a.

"Ee scac be thee in this pace thee
That have in ove done o said *e in ;"*   *ie in  pects*

And so that wh the poem s y not se the eade --
but it actuy was done, o it sh yet be done. The Boo sets
t with the visit o Pandaus to Csida:--

And cast, and new in *ood p* was the Moon     *ave ect*
To do voya, and too his way u soon
Unto his niece's ace thee beside
Now Janus, od o enty, th him uide!

Pandaus inds his niece, with two othe adies, in a d
pa, stenin to a i who eads d the s o the
Sie o Thebes. Geetin the company, he is wecomed by
Csida, who tes him that o thee ns she has d o
him. A some v t t the boo they had b
eadin, Pandaus ass his niece to do away he hood, to show
he ace bae, to ay aside the boo, to ise up and dance, "and
et us do to May some obsevance." Csida cies t, "God
obid!" and ass i he is d -- i that is a widow's e, whom it
bet becomes to sit in a cave and ead o hoy saints' ves.
Pandaus intites that he cd te he somethin wh cd
e he mey; but he euses to atiy he iity; and, by
way o the sie and o Hecto, "that was the towne's w, and
Geees' yed" o scin-od, the consation is bht
nd to Toius, whom Pandaus hihy  as "the wise
hy Hecto the second." She has, she says, eady head
Toius pai o his bay "o t that he wee eest
pai be" [by whom it wd be mt wecome to he to be
pai].

"Ye say  sooth, y-wis," uoth Pandaus;
Fo , who so had with him b,
M have wonde'd u Toius;
Fo ne yet so t a swam o b*                            *bees
Ne ew, as did o Geees om him ee'n;
And thh the ied, in ev'y we's ea,
Thee was no cy but 'Toius is hee.'

"Now hee, now thee, he hunted t so ast,
Thee was but Geees' bood; and Toius
Now him he hut, now him adown he cast;
Ay whee he went it was aayed s:
He was thei d, and s o e o us,
That as that day thee  him none withstand,
Whie that he hed his boody sw in hand."

Pandaus es now a show o tain eave, but Csida
s him, to spea o he aais; then, the business ted
o, he wd aain o, but ist aain ass his niece to aise
and dance, and cast he widow's aments to misce,
because o the ad otune that has been he. Moe is
than e, she sees to ind t Pandaus' secet; but he sti
paies he iity, siuy hintin  the time at he ood
otune, and the wisdom o  on it when oeed. In the
end he tes he that the nobe Toius so oves he, that with he
it es to e him ve o die -- but i Toius dies, Pandaus
sh die with him; and then she wi have "ished ai." <14> He
beses mecy o his iend:

"*Woe h* the aie mme vitueess! <15>             *evi be!*
Woe h the heb so that *doth no boot!*     *has no emedi powe*

Pandaus es ony the s euest that she wi show
Toius somewhat bet chee, and eceive visits om him, that
his e y be saved; uin that, thh a n be soon oin
to the tempe,  wi thin that he  the is; and
that "such ove o iends th in  this town."

Leavin Csida to ep, the poet ets to Toius and his
es iend -- with whe statams to bin the two 
tothe the einde o the Second Boo is occupied.
Pandaus cnses Toius to wite a et to his mists,
ten he how he "a ss," and "beseen he o uth;"
he wi bea the et to his niece; and, i Toius wi e past
Csida's hse, he wi ind his mists and his iend sittin
at a window. Sutin Pandaus, and not tayin, his passa
wi ive occasion o some t o him, wh y e his
eas ow. With pect to the et, Pandaus ives some
sd hints:

"Tn thy et, th at wise enh,

"No * ee no disc thin y-ee,**        * **tothe

Fo i a pain wde paint a pie
With ass's eet, and head it as an ape,<32>
It *'ceth not,* so wee it but a jape."           *is not hamonis*

Toius wites the et, and next monin Pandaus beas it to
Csida. She euses to eceive "scip o bi that tch such
te;" but he sts it into he bom, chenin he to
thow it away. She etains it, taes the ist oppotunity o
escapin to he chambe to ead it, inds it whoy ood, and,
 he unce's ,  a epy ten he o that
she wi not e hese bnd in ove; "but as his sis, him
to se, she wd aye ain [be ad] to do his heat an ease."
Pandaus,  petext o inuiin who is the owne o the
hse oppite, has one to the window; Csida taes he
et to him thee, and tes him that she ne did a thin with
moe pain than wite the  to wh he had d
he. As they sit side by side, on a se o je, on a 
o beaten od, Toius es by, in  his . Csida
wes "as ed as e," as she sees him sute humby, "with
deadu chee, and ot his hues  [chan];" she es "
y-ee, his peson, his aay, his oo, his chee, his oody
nne, and his nteness;" so that, howe she y have
b be, "to oode hope now hath she cauht a thon, she
sh not pu it t this nexte wee." Pandaus, stiin the ion
when it is hot, ass his niece to  Toius an inw; but
she  decnes, o ea o scand, and because it is 
too soon to ow him so eat a bety -- he pupe bein to
ove him unnown o , "and uedon [ewad] him with
nothin but with s." Pandaus has othe ; and,
whie Toius wites dy ets with inceasin ove, he

the b o Toius, he tes him that Csida is in dan o
vioence om Poype, and ass tection o he.
Deiphobus ady compes, mises the tection o Hecto
and Heen, and oes to invite Csida to dinne on the moow.
Meime Pandaus  Toius to o to the hse o
Deiphobus, d an access o his e o einin  n,
and eep his chambe next day. "Lo," says the caty mo
o ove, boowin a phase om the huntin-ied; "Lo, hod
thee at thy tiste [tyst <33>] ce, and I sh we the dee

comes to dinne; and at te, Heen, Pandaus, and othes,
paise the sent Toius, unti "he heat auhs" o y pe

we, wh Hecto has sent o his opinion; Heen and
Deiphobus, en in peus and discussion, oam t o

sti with Toius, bins Csida to he o. The Second
Boo eaves Pandaus whispein in his niece's ea cnse to

whie Toius es "in a anedot," <34> heain the

To the Thid Boo is peixed a beautiu invocation o Venus,

Knowin that Venus has set a aw in the unise, that who
 with he sh have the we, the poet pays to be
tauht to descibe some o the joy that is et in he sevice; and
the Thid Boo opens with an accnt o the scene betw
Toius and Csida:

Lay  this ne whie Toius
Recin* his esson in this nnee;                       *memoiin
*"My ay!"* thht he, "s wi I say, and s;       *by my aith!*
Thus wi I pain* unto my ady dea;                    *e my paint
That w is ood; and this sh be my chee
This wi I not otten in no wise;"
God et him woen as he can de.

And, L! so as his heat bean to uap,*                  *uae, p
Heain he comin, and *shot o to sie;*          *e shot sihs*
And Pandaus, that ed he by the ap,*                           *

And saide: "God do boot* e sic!                  *a a emedy to

Lo! hee is she that is *y d to wite!"*	*to bame o y d*

Theewith it seemed as he wept mt.
"Ah! ah! God hep!" uoth Toius ueuy;
"Whe'e* me be woe, O my God, th now'st!                 *he
Who is thee? o I see not tu."
"Si," uoth Cside, "it is Pandae and I;
"Yea, sweete heat? as, I y not ise
To nee and do y hon in some wise."

And d him upwad, and she  tho*                         *then
Gan both he handes sot u him ay.
"O! o the ove o God, do ye not so

Cside  this espied we enow, --
Fo she was wise, -- and ov'd him ne'e the ess,
A n'ee he pet, no de avow,
No was so bod to sin a ooe's ss;<40>
But, when his shame bean somewhat to pass,

Then, beseen Pandaus soon to peom t the eat

Toius, by his discetion, his sececy, and his devotion, de
e a deepe odment in Csida's heat; so that she thaned
God twenty and times that she had met with a n who,
as she et, "was to he a w o stee, and s om ev'y

pas a "time sweet" o  and hamonis ove the ony

Toius had inomed his hsehod, that i at any time he was
, he had one to w at a cetain tempe o Apoo,
"and ist to see the hoy aue uae, o that the odde spae
t o the tee." So, at the chanin o the moon, when "the
wein shope him o to ain," [when the sy was pepain to
ain] Pandaus went to invite his niece to suppe; soemny
assuin he that Toius was t o the town -- thh  the
time he was sa shut up, ti midn, in "a tte stew,"
whence thh a hoe he joysy ched the aiv o his
mists and he ai niece Antione, with h a scoe o he
women. A suppe Pandaas did eythin to amuse his
niece; "he sun, he pay'd, he tod a te o Wade;" <52> at ast
she wd tae he eave; but

The  Moone with he hones e,

That de such a ain om heav'n av,*                       *descend

At wh Pandaus auh'd, and saide then
"Now wee it time a ady to o hen!"*                             *hence

He thee  Csida to ein  n; she compes
with a ood ace; and a the epin cup has one nd,
 etie to thei chambes -- Csida, that she y not be
distubed by the ain and th, bein odd in the "inne
cet" o Pandaus, who, to u suspicion, occupies the 
chambe, his niece's women epin in the inmediate
apatment. When  is uiet, Pandaus beates Toius, and by
a secet passa bins him to the chambe o Csida; then,
oin owad one to his niece, a  he eas o
discoy, he tes he that he o has "thh a ut, by a
pivy went," [a secet passa] come to his hse in  this ain,
d with ie because a iend has tod him that she oves
Hstes. Sudy cod t he heat, Csida mises that
on the moow she wi eassue he o; but Pandaus scts
the notion o deay, auhs to scon he p to send he
in in ped o he tuth, and iny, by  accnts o
Toius' ie, s he to eceive him and eassue him at
once with he own .

This Toius u soon on nees him set,
Fu ey,  by he bedde's head,
And in his beste wise his ady et*                            *eeted
But L! how she w'd sudy  ed,
And thht anon how that she wd be dead;
She cde not one w a t bin,
So sudy o his sud comin.

Csida, thh thinin that he sev and he n shd
not have dbted he tuth, yet sht to emove his jesy,
and oeed to submit to any e o oath he m impe;
then, weepin, she coed he ace, and ay sient. "But now,"
excs the poet --

But now hep, God, to n  this soow!
So hope I that he sh, o he best y;
Fo I have s, o a u mi moow,*                          *mon

That a s * be victoies.           *concts, 

Beevin his mists to be any, Toius et the  o
d seie on his heat, "and down he e  sudy in

pu t the thon that stuc in his heat, by misin that she
wd " oive." She whispeed in his ea the assuance that
she was not h; and at ast,  he cases, he ecoed
ness, to ind he am aid o him, to hea the
assuance o he ess, and eceive he euent s.
Fh vo and expanations pas; and Csida impoed
ess o "he own sweet heat," o the pain she had
cau him. Supi with sud bss, Toius put  in God's
hand, and  his ady ast in his ams. "What m o y
the se [inno] ae say, when that the spehaw
[spaowhaw] hath him in his oot?"

Csida, wh that et he s y-tae,
As wite s in thei booes od,

When she him et he in his ames od;
But Toius,  *whoe o ca cod,*   *ed o painu soo*<55>
Gan thane then the bssu oddes seven. <56>
Thus sundy paines bin o to n.

This Toius he an in ames stain,
And said, "O sweet, as e y I o'n,*                        *spe
Now be ye cauht, now hee is but we t,

THE FOURTH BOOK


A BRIEF Poem to the Fth Boo pepa us o the

t o his ady's ace, and on he whee she set up Diomede."
Then the naative descibes a simish in wh the Tojans

exchan o pisones; and as soon as Cchas head the ne,
he came to the assemby o the Gees, to "bid a boon." Havin
d audience, he eminded the besies how he had come
om Toy to aid and enca t in thei enpise; win

whom he bity eached himse o eavin behind. And
now, with sten teas and pitiu paye, he besht t

was at hand when they shd have both town and peope. The
soothsaye's petition was ed; and the ambassad chad

And athe die than that she shde o;
But Reason said him, on the othe side,

Bity in Fotune, and cn on Love to expain why his

Soon Toius, thh excess o ie, e into a tance; in

Whie Toius was in  this heaviness, disputin with himse in

Tojans wd have both he and Anteno; whie, to acitate

Yet Toius was not so we at ease, that he did not eane

Csida, with a sih,  in this wise

In the monin, Diomede was eady to es Csida to the

And, L! so she an weepe tendey!
And he u sot and sy an he say,

With that his cse ted he t,

And Toius to Toye ho went.

This Diomede, that ed he by the be,
When that he saw the o o Toy away,
Thht, "A my  sh not be *on ide,*               *in  vain*

But natheess, this thht he we enh,

So he bean a ne consation, as he o not ess

"Thus said I ne e'e now to won bon;

Csida answeed his discses as thh she scac head

accepted his oeed iends -- misin to tust him, as we
she m. Then she ed om he steed, and, with he heat
nih beain, was wecomed to the embace o he athe.
Meanwhie Toius, bac in Toy, was amentin with teas the

days, and spendin the n in win, epess tsin, and
tbs deams. In the monin he was visited by Pandaus,
to whom he ave  o his une; desiin that the
powde into wh his heat was bed shd be ept in a

cnses and consoations, eminded his iend that ten days
wee a shot time to wait,  aainst his aith in evi
deams, and ud him to tae adva o the tuce, and
beuie the time by a visit to Kin Sapedon (a Lycian Pince
who had come to aid the Tojans). Sapedon entained t
spendidy; but no eastin, no pomp, no music o instuments,
no sinin o ai adies, cd e up o the sence o
Csida to the desoate Toius, who was o e  u
he od ets, and ecn he oved om. Thus he "dove to
an end" the th day, and wd have then eted to Toy,
but o the  o Pandaus, who a i they had
visited Sapedon ony to etch ie? At ast, at the end o a
wee, they eted to Toy; Toius hopin to ind Csida
aain in the city, Pandaus entainin a  wh he
conceed om his iend. The monin a thei et,
Toius was impatient ti he had one to the ace o Csida;
but when he nd he do  ced, "we nih o soow

Theewith, when he was wae, and an behod
How shut was ev'y window o the pace,
As  him thht his he *an to cod;*      *bean to ow cod*
Fo wh, with chand deady e ace,
Withte w, he oth bean to pace;
And, as God wd, he an so aste e,
That no w o his cntenance espied.

Then said he s: "O ace desoate!

O ace empty and disconsoate!

Fom thence oth he eth up and down,
And ev'y thin came him to emembance,
As he ode by the  o the town,
In wh he whiom had  his sance;
"Lo! yonde saw I mine own ady dance;
And in that tempe, with he eyen cea,

"And yonde have I head u ustiy

Then he went to the ates, and aed on the way by wh
he had attended Csida at he depatue; then he cied that

By n he payed the moon to un ast t he sphee; by

But she was , ee two months, to be u a om any such

CHAUCER'S DREAM.


[This petty eoy, o athe conceit, containin one o two
passas that o vividness and o decacy yied to nothin in
the whoe an o Chauce's poety, had ne b pinted
be the yea 1597, when it was incuded in the edition o
Speht. Be that date, indeed, a Deam o Chauce had b
pinted; but the poem so descibed was in eity "The Boo o
the Du; o the D o Banche, Du o Lancas" --
wh is not incuded in the pent edition. Speht says that
"This Deam, ded by Chauce, seemeth to be a  epot
o the ia o John o G, the Kin's son, with Banche,
the dauh o Heny, Due o Lancas; who a on ove
(duin the time wheeo the poet th t to be dead)
wee in the end, by consent o iends, happiy ied; 
by a bid binin in his bi an heb, wh e t to e
aain. Hee so is sh Chauce's tch with a cetain
ntewon, who, thh she was a stan, was,
notwithstandin, so we ed and oved o the Lady Banche
and he L, as Chauce himse so was, that ady they
concuded a ia betw t." John o G, at the a
o ninet, and whie yet Ea o Richmond, was ied to the
Lady Banche at Readin in May 1359; Chauce, then a pisone
in Fance, by did not et to Enand ti peace was
concuded in the oowin yea; so that his ia to Ppa
Roet, the sis o the Du Banche's avite attend
Kathaine Roet, cd not have taen pace ti some time a
that o the Due. In the poem, it is epented to have
immediat o; but no conseuence need be atd to
that . Enh that it o at no eat inv o
time; and that the intite s wh Chauce had eady
beun to om with John o G, m we wa him in
witin this poem on the occasion o the Due's ia, and
in  his own ove-otunes with the o the pinci
iu. In the essay ment o the poem o the
pent edition, the subsidiay banch o the eoy, eatin to
the poet's own ove aai, has b so a as ibe sepaated
om the in banch, wh  oth the otunes o John
and Banche. The poem, in u, contains, with an "Envoy"
 appended, 2233 nes; o wh 510 ae iven hee.]
(Tanscibe's note: mo schs beeve that Chauce was
not the autho o this poem)

THE PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN.


[SOME diece o opinion exists as to the date at
wh Chauce e "The Lend o Good
Women." The who wd ix that date at a
peiod not on be the poet's d -- who
wd pace the poem, indeed, amon his cin
s -- suppot thei opinion by the act that the
Poe ecites mt o Chauce's pinci
w, and ances, besides, at a on aay o
othe ductions, too ny to be uy cated.
But, on the othe hand, it is  that the
"Lend" es no mention o "The Cebuy
Tes" as such; whie two o the Tes -- the
Kn's and the Second Nun's -- ae enuted
by the tites wh they boe as sepaate
compitions, be they wee incopted in the
eat ion: "The Love o Pamon and
Acite," and "The Lie o Saint Cecie" (see note 1
to the Second Nun's te). Tywhitt seems peecty
justiied in pacin the compition o the poem
immediat be that o Chauce's num
opus, and a the ia o Richad II to his
ist u, Anne o Bohe. That event too
pace in 1382; and since it is to Anne that the poet
ees when he es Acestis bid him ive his
poem to the u "at Etham o at Sh," the
"Lend" cd not have b  eae. The
od editions te us that "se adies in the Ct
too oence at Chauce's a spes aainst
the untuth o women; thee the u enjoin'd
him to compie this boo in the comation o
sundy is and wives, who show'd tseves
ai to aithess men. This seems to have b
 a The Fowe and the Lea." Eviy it
was, o distinct eeces to that poem ae to be
nd in the Poe; but moe intetin is the
indication wh it is, that "Toius and
Csida" was the wo, not o the poet's yth,
but o his  a. We cd hady expect the
u -- he o Love o o Enand -- to
d seisy om Chauce a eation o
 wh he had exed a u
neation be, and o wh he had de
aement by the spendid paises o tue ove sun
in "The Ct o Love," "The Cucoo and the
Nine," and othe poems o yth and midde
e. But "Toius and Csida" is cped with
"The Ronce o the Re," as one o the poems
wh had iven oence to the sevs and the
God o Love; thee we y suppe it to have
moe minenty enad cty notice at a a
peiod o the poet's e, than even its ubted
popuaity cd expain. At  date, o in
 cicumstances, taen, "The Lend
o Good Women" is a ament. Thee ae se
sins that it was desined to contain the stoies o
twenty-ive adies, thh the numbe o the
ood women is in the poem itse set down at
ninet; but nine ends ony wee actuy
comped, o have come down to us. They ae,
the o Ceopata Qu o Eypt (126 nes),
Thisbe o Byon (218), Dido Qu o Catha
(442), Hypye and Medea (312), Lucece o
Rome (206), Aiadne o Athens (340), Phio
(167), Phys (168), and Hypemnesta (162).
Peixed to te stoies, wh ae tansated o
 om Ovid, is a Poe containin 579
nes -- the ony pat o the "Lend" iven in the
pent edition. It is by a the mt oiin, the
stonst, and mt sin pat o the poem; the
desciption o spin, and o his enjoyment o that
season, ae in Chauce's best nne; and the
potic phiophy by wh Acestis  the
